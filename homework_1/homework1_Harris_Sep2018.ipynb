      "Objective:\n",
      "Our objective was to determine whether DoD is meeting access to care standards for acute and routine appointments at selected military treatment facilities.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "Federal regulations establish access to care standards for the Military Health System, including providing patients an appointment to visit a provider within 7 days for a routine appointment and 24 hours for an urgent appointment. Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) guidance states that DoD beneficiaries must be offered routine and urgent appointments within the established standards. When health care is not available within access to care standards at the MTF, beneficiaries can receive health care outside of the MTF. The Defense Health Agency’s (DHA) access to care metrics measure the ability of the MTFs to meet the standard of urgent and routine appointments. \n",
      "According to DoD guidance, the DHA Director coordinates with the Military Departments regarding administration of MTFs. However, public law changed the DHA’s responsibilities regarding the MTFs. Beginning October 1, 2018, the DHA Director will be responsible for the administration of each MTF, and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Military Departments, will maintain the MTFs. \n",
      "In the Preliminary Draft Interim Report delivered on March 31, 2017, the DoD confirmed the Secretary of Defense’s decision to implement a new model to address the requirements listed in the law. The Department will submit a final report to Congress by June 30, 2018.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "The DoD did not consistently meet the access to care standards for urgent and routine appointments at selected MTFs. Based on DHA metrics, three of the seven MTFs we visited, Irwin Army Community Hospital at Fort Riley, Kansas; Naval Hospital Pensacola, Pensacola, Florida; and Naval Health Clinic Hawaii at Joint Base Pearl Harbor, Hickam, Hawaii met access to care standards for routine and urgent appointments and one MTF, Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, met access to care standards for 4 of 5 months between January and May 2017. \n",
      "However, three Air Force MTFs—U.S. Air Force Hospital Langley at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia; David Grant U.S. Air Force Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, California; and MacDill Air Force Base Clinic at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida—did not consistently meet access to care standards. For example, in February 2017, U.S. Air Force Hospital Langley did not meet the 7-day routine appointment metric by 15.8 days (226 percent). Additionally, in March 2017, David Grant U.S. Air Force Medical Center did not meet the 1-day urgent appointment metric by 7.2 days (720 percent). \n",
      "The Air Force MTFs did not meet beneficiary demand for appointments because the Air Force Surgeon General: \n",
      "\n",
      "assigned a higher number of patients per health care provider compared to the Army and Navy; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "did not establish policy to consistently decrease the number of appointments per provider to compensate for their other duties (except for flight commanders); \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "did not pay comparable salaries for civilian nursing personnel; and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "did not have authority to direct Air Force medical personnel. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the 105,000 MHS beneficiaries enrolled at the three Air Force MTFs we visited may not have received the care they needed, and may have been at risk of increased health complications due to longer wait times. In March 2017, beneficiaries waited as long as 8.2 days on average for an urgent appointment at David Grant U.S. Air Force Medical Center and, in February 2017, beneficiaries waited as long as 22.8 days on average for a routine appointment at U.S. Air Force Hospital Langley. Because of the DHA’s oversight and assumption of expanded responsibilities for MTFs, we made recommendations to the DHA Director instead of the Air Force Surgeon General.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the DHA Director establish a standard method across the Military Departments for calculating the number of patients assigned to each provider and establish a standard method for decreasing the number of appointments per provider based on their additional duties. Additionally, the DHA Director should convene a working group with personnel from the Military Departments’ Surgeons General and the Air Force Personnel Center to conduct a review to determine if position descriptions and pay grades for civilian medical personnel assigned to MTFs are consistent, and consider standardizing position descriptions and pay grades across the Military Departments. Finally, we recommend that the DHA Director, in coordination with the Air Force Surgeon General, develop a plan outlining how the DHA will assume authority, direction, and control over Air Force MTFs to make changes necessary to improve access to care and hold MTF commanders accountable when the MTFs do not meet access to care standards.\n",
      "Management Actions Taken:\n",
      "The DHA Director agreed with our finding and recommendations. The Director agreed to implement additional standard business rules to calculate empanelment sizes to reduce variances at MTFs and establish a standard method for decreasing the number of appointments that are scheduled for certain providers based on those providers’ additional assigned duties. Additionally, the Director agreed to convene a working group to review position descriptions and pay grades. Finally, the Director agreed to develop a plan on how the DHA will hold MTF commanders accountable for meeting access to care standards. Therefore, these recommendations are resolved but remain open. We will close the recommendations once we verify that the DHA has implemented the planned corrective actions. \n",
      "The Air Force Surgeon General provided comments and requested technical changes to the report, some of which we incorporated in the final report and others we did not. See the Finding section for a summary of those comments and our response.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Navy is effectively managing the development of a mine countermeasures (MCM) mission package that will allow the Littoral Combat Ship to detect and neutralize or avoid mines in support of fleet operations. For this audit, we focused on the MCM mission package systems that the Navy declared had met their initial operational capability (IOC) requirements. According to DoD Instruction 5000.02, IOC is achieved when the selected user has been equipped and trained and is determined to be capable of conducting mission operations.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The Littoral Combat Ship MCM mission package supports MCM operations through the employment of aviation assets and unmanned surface and submersible vehicles. These assets and vehicles are equipped with an array of sensors and systems to detect, localize, and neutralize surface, near-surface, in-volume, and bottom mines. The MCM mission package includes s even systems. Our review focused on three systems that the Navy had declared met IOC. Specifically, we reviewed the AN/ASQ‑235 Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS), Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS), and Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) Block I systems.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "We determined that the Navy declared IOC for the three MCM mission package systems reviewed prior to demonstrating that the systems were effective and suitable for their intended operational uses. \n",
      "This occurred because the Director, Expeditionary Warfare Division (N95) declared IOC for the ALMDS and AMNS after Chief of Naval Operations and Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition) officials approved a plan to pursue IOC to gather data and lessons learned. To deliver the systems to the fleet, N95 used the results of a technical evaluation and previous test events to justify its IOC decisions without demonstrating that it had corrected known performance problems. Additionally, N95 relied on data gathered during the first of five test periods to justify the COBRA Block I IOC decision, even though the program did not fully meet a key performance parameter (primary requirement). We determined that N95 declared IOC for the COBRA Block I to avoid requesting a sixth change to the IOC date that would further delay the delivery of the system’s capabilities to the fleet. \n",
      "As a result, the Navy delivered units that have known performance problems to the fleet for use aboard the Littoral Combat Ship and other platforms. The MCM mission package operates as an integrated family of systems. Each of the seven systems needs to provide full capability and operate in conjunction with each other in order to accomplish the MCM mission. Consequently, if the Navy proceeds as planned it will spend money on ALMDS, AMNS, and COBRA Block I production units that cannot fully perform their mine detection and neutralization missions. This in turn could lead to degraded mission performance, delayed delivery of needed capabilities, and the need to pull those units off-line and spend additional money to correct shortcomings in the fielded units.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Director, Expeditionary Warfare Division, delay future procurement of Airborne Laser Mine Detection System, Airborne Mine Neutralization System, and Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis Block I until the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition) and Chief of Naval Operations require the Program Manager, Mine Warfare Office, to complete operational test and evaluations demonstrating the systems are effective and suitable to support full-rate production.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition), responding for the Navy, disagreed with the report’s finding and recommendation. The Assistant Secretary stated that test results during 2015 and 2017 had demonstrated the systems either met or exceeded their primary requirements. The Assistant Secretary further stated that the testing balanced comprehensiveness with speed of delivery to the fleet and is aligned with the national defense strategy tenet of “delivering performance at the speed of relevance.” \n",
      "The Assistant Secretary stated that the incremental approach to fielding each of the seven system in the LCS MCM mission package facilitates a more rapid and seamless transition from legacy MCM to the future modular MCM force. The Assistant Secretary also stated that the procurement must continue to ensure that a capability exists to replace the decommissioning MCM 1 Avenger Class ships and MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter, thereby saving the Navy operating and production costs.\n",
      "We disagree that the systems met the requirements for declaring IOC. In the memoranda issued declaring IOC for ALMDS and AMNS, N95 stated that the ALMDS and AMNS programs had not executed a complete initial operational test and evaluation according to the IOC definition. Therefore, the ALMDS and AMNS programs have not demonstrated that the systems are operationally effective and have met the requirements for declaring IOC. For the COBRA Block I program, the production document defines IOC as delivery of one system, new equipment training, initial spares, and support equipment to the unit. While the COBRA Block I program met that limited definition, the COBRA Block I system does not meet DoD Instruction’s 5000.02 definition for declaring IOC. Specifically, the Navy has not yet demonstrated that the COBRA Block I system is able to conduct its full portfolio of mission operations. \n",
      "After receiving the Navy’s comments to the draft report, we met with senior Navy officials to discuss the Navy’s position and received an update on the systems’ development. The officials contend that having the training squadrons use the systems was the best way to identify and correct performance gaps, enhance lethality, and more rapidly change the paradigm in the MCM force. The officials stated the systems provide relevant advantage over our adversaries and the Navy had taken actions to address the performance shortcomings identified during the aforementioned test events. The officials stated that the MCM training squadrons currently working with ALMDS and AMNS systems have not reported any problems. The officials also stated that preliminary analysis of additional testing conducted on the COBRA Block I system supported that many of its performance shortcomings had been corrected.\n",
      "While this approach may allow for a more rapid transition to the future modular MCM force, the Navy still needs to mitigate the impact of its approach. Entering full-rate production without demonstrating a system can perform as required may require costly retrofits to fix undiscovered system deficiencies. In addition, the approach could also result in having to delay the planned decommissioning of legacy ships, helicopters, and associated equipment if deficiencies also render the new system unable to perform the full MCM mission set. \n",
      "If the Navy continues its procurement of additional ALMDS, AMNS, and COBRA Block I systems to enable the timely decommissioning of the MCM 1 Avenger Class ships and MH-53E, it should continually improve those systems based on feedback identified by Fleet users.\n",
      "Based on management’s comments to the draft report and our follow on meetings with senior Navy officials regarding their comments, we consider the recommendation resolved. The recommendation can be closed once the Navy: (1) provides documentation that the performance deficiencies identified in prior testing of the ALMDS, AMNS, and COBRA Block I systems have been corrected; and (2) demonstrates progress towards achieving its full portfolio of mission operations, while mitigating the risk of costly retrofits.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Air Force Space Command implemented an adequate supply chain risk management program for four critical strategic systems. Specifically, we conducted a detailed review of the Space Based Infrared System and a limited review of the Air Force Satellite Control Network, the Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, and the Global Positioning System. \n",
      "We conducted this audit in response to a reporting requirement contained in House Report 114-537, to accompany House Report 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. This is the second in a series of audits on supply chain risk management for DoD strategic capabilities in response to the Congressional requirement.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The Space Based Infrared System is a follow-on capability to the Defense Support Program satellites, which help protect the U.S. and its allies by detecting missile launches, space launches, and nuclear detonation. \n",
      "The Air Force Satellite Control Network is a global system providing command, control, and communications for space vehicles. \n",
      "The Family of Advanced Beyond Line‑of‑Sight Terminals develops nuclear event-survivable terminals capable of communicating with satellite constellations using jam-resistant, low probability of intercept and low probability of detection waveforms for airborne, ground-fixed, and transportable applications.\n",
      "The Global Positioning System is a constellation of orbiting satellites that provides navigation data to military and civilian users all over the world. \n",
      "The supply chain is the sequence of activities necessary to provide an end user with a finished product or system (from raw material to finished product). The activities include designing, manufacturing, producing, packaging, handling, storing, transporting, operating, maintaining, and disposing. \n",
      "Supply chain risk is the vulnerability that an adversary may sabotage, maliciously introduce an unwanted function, or otherwise compromise the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of a system. The adversary may take these actions to surveil, deny, disrupt, or otherwise degrade the function, use, or operation of the system. \n",
      "DoD supply chain risk management policy requires DoD organizations to identify critical information and communications technology components, purchase those components from trusted suppliers, and test and evaluate critical components for malicious threats.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "The Air Force Space Command established initiatives to manage supply chain risk for the Space Based Infrared System but did not fully implement DoD supply chain risk management policy. This occurred because the Air Force Space Command did not take the steps and establish the controls and oversight necessary to:\n",
      "·        conduct a thorough criticality analysis and identify all critical components and associated suppliers to manage risks to the system throughout its lifecycle;\n",
      "·        submit complete and accurate requests to conduct threat assessments of critical component suppliers;\n",
      "·        require the purchase of all application-specific integrated circuits from trusted suppliers using trusted processes that are accredited; or \n",
      "·        ensure the use of rigorous test and evaluation capabilities, including developmental, acceptance, and operational testing\n",
      "In addition, our limited review of three other Air Force Space Command critical systems revealed concerns similar to those found with the Space Based Infrared System supply chain risk management. \n",
      "As a result, an adversary has opportunity to infiltrate the Air Force Space Command supply chain and sabotage, maliciously introduce an unwanted function, or otherwise compromise the design or integrity of the critical hardware, software, and firmware.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Air Force Space Command Commander develop a plan of action, with milestones, for the Space Based Infrared System to comply with DoD supply chain risk management policy. The plan should establish controls and oversight and require Air Force Space Command personnel to develop internal procedures or establish contract requirements to:\n",
      "·        improve the accuracy of the critical components list to manage risks to the Space Based Infrared System throughout its life cycle and require the identification of all critical logic-bearing hardware, software, and firmware, and the associated suppliers;\n",

      "·        ensure the use of rigorous test and evaluation capabilities, including developmental, acceptance, and operational testing, and require establishment of verification and validation procedures for critical logic-bearing hardware, software, and firmware. \n",
      "We also recommend that the Air Force Space Command Commander conduct a detailed review of the supply chain risk management for the Air Force Satellite Control Network, Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, and Global Positioning System programs, and all other programs deemed critical to the Air Force Space Command, to ensure compliance with DoD supply chain risk management policy. If deficiencies are identified, Air Force Space Command officials must develop a plan of action with milestones to correct the deficiencies.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Air Force Space Command Space and Missile Systems Center Vice Commander, responding for the Air Force Space Command Commander, agreed with the recommendations and stated that the Air Force Space Command will improve the supply chain risk management for the Space Based Infrared System and:\n",
      "·        conduct a criticality analysis to accurately identify and compile a parts list for all critical components;\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether Air Force officials updated the Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System (EPAWSS) test and evaluation master plan to respond to concerns raised by Air Force and DoD test officials, developed an EPAWSS design that can meet capability requirements, and evaluated the F-15C EPAWSS production plan during the engineering and manufacturing development phase.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The Air Force’s EPAWSS program is an acquisition category IC major defense program with estimated program costs of $876 million in research, development, test, and evaluation, and $3.4 billion in procurement.1 EPAWSS upgrades F-15C and F-15E aircraft electronic warfare capabilities to detect and identify air and ground threats, employ counter-measures, and jam enemy radar signals. The F-15 is an all-weather, day and night, tactical fighter aircraft designed to gain and maintain control over the battlefield.\n",
      "In November 2016, EPAWSS program officials started the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the acquisition cycle and began to develop, build, and test EPAWSS prototypes to verify that capability requirements have been met and to support production decisions. In August 2019, EPAWSS program officials plan to begin production and installation of EPAWSS on F-15 aircraft. The Air Force planned to upgrade 196 F-15C and 217 F-15E aircraft with EPAWSS during the production phase.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "EPAWSS program officials updated the test and evaluation master plan to respond to concerns raised by Air Force and DoD test officials. Additionally, EPAWSS program officials developed an EPAWSS design that can meet capability requirements.\n",
      "Furthermore, in September 2016, the Air Force fully funded the EPAWSS program through production to satisfy an urgent need for modernized F-15 electronic warfare capabilities. However, in February 2017, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Strategic Plans and Requirements (DCS AF/A5/8) cancelled the upgrade of 196 F-15C aircraft with EPAWSS and removed procurement funds, which resulted in a 47 percent decrease of the total program production quantity.\n",
      "The quantity decrease of the F-15C EPAWSS production units and the removal of funds occurred because the DCS AF/A5/8 decided to use F-15C EPAWSS procurement funds to develop a higher priority air superiority program. However, DCS AF/A5/8 officials did not request Joint Requirements Oversight Council revalidation to verify whether the quantity decrease that was over 10 percent would adversely impact the warfighter’s capability.\n",
      "As a result, Air Force officials do not know the full impact to other aircraft missions within and across the portfolios and Services without Joint Requirements Oversight Council revalidation of the decrease of F-15C EPAWSS production quantities. Using the F-15C aircraft without EPAWSS will limit the warfighter’s ability to detect and identify air and ground threats, employ counter-measures, and jam enemy radar signals.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend the DCS AF/A5/8 request that the Joint Requirements Oversight Council revalidate the F-15C EPAWSS quantity to ensure that air superiority missions can still be met without the F-15C EPAWSS. Additionally, we recommend the DCS AF/A5/8 issue a revision that includes F-15C EPAWSS procurement funds if Congress does not approve the F-15C aircraft retirement.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Director of Staff for DCS, Strategic Plans, Programs, and Requirements, responding for the DCS AF/A5/8, agreed with and addressed all specifics of the recommendations. The Director of Staff stated that Air Force officials would submit the updated EPAWSS production quantity to the Joint Requirements Oversight Council for review and revalidation by first quarter 2019.\n",
      "In addition, the Director of Staff stated that Air Force officials would provide Congress with specific plans and justifications for retiring the F-15C aircraft. If Congress does not approve the F-15C aircraft retirement, the Director of Staff stated that Air Force officials would review the requirement and restore procurement funding for sufficient EPAWSS quantities to provide increased F-15C electronic warfare capabilities, as the mission requires. Therefore, these recommendations are resolved but will remain open. We will close these recommendations once we verify that the Joint Requirements Oversight Council has revalidated the decrease of F-15C EPAWSS production quantities or Air Force officials restore procurement funds if Congress does not approve the F-15C aircraft retirement.\n",

      "Background:\n",
      "The JLTV program is a joint Army and Marine Corps acquisition effort developed to replace the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle. The JLTV program provides the Army and Marine Corps with a general-purpose, light tactical vehicle that is designed to deliver an optimal balance of protection, payload, and performance to enhance the effectiveness of ground combat and supporting forces. The Army and Marine Corps plan to purchase 56,340 JLTVs from FY 2015 to FY 2037. As of December 25, 2017, the JLTV total life-cycle cost estimate is approximately $48 billion. The JLTV has two variants: a four-seat vehicle that can carry 3,500 pounds, and a two-seat vehicle that can carry 5,100 pounds. The four-seat variant has three mission package configurations—general purpose, heavy guns carrier, and close combat weapons carrier. The two-seat variant has one configuration, the utility/shelter carrier vehicle.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "The Army and Marine Corps developed adequate test plans but have not demonstrated effective test results to prepare the JLTV program for full rate production. We reviewed eight maintenance-related vehicle performance requirements for the JLTV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The requirements developer, the Marine Corps Assistant Deputy Commandant, Combat Development and Integration, has acknowledged and accepted the JLTV test results. Consequently, the requirements developer is not changing requirements, and is choosing not to incorporate the unmet maintenance-related vehicle performance requirements in the baseline vehicle to maintain program cost and schedule. Despite not meeting all maintenance related performance requirements, the Joint Program Office estimates JLTV operations and support costs will be reduced by $8.3 billion due to better fuel usage and better reliability than expected. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the JLTV requirements developer did not clearly define vehicle requirements.\n",

Therefore, this recommendation is resolved but remains open. We will close this recommendation when we verify that program officials have determined the costs are affordable and incorporated into the final cost of the JLTV.\n",

      "We determined whether the Army supported its decision to transition Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing from a contracted service to an in-house capability.1 In addition, we reviewed the Navy’s testing plans.\n",
      "The House Committee on Appropriations requested that we review the Army’s business case analysis to transition HIV testing from a contracted service to an in-house capability.  In addition, House Report 114-577, to accompany the House Report 5293, “Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017,” expressed concern with the decisions by the Army and Navy to transition HIV testing from a contracted service to an in-house capability.  The report directed the DoD Office of Inspector General to examine the business case analyses and provide a report on its findings to the congressional defense committees.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "We determined that Walter Reed Army Institute of Research personnel did not adequately support or document their business case analysis for bringing HIV testing in-house.  This occurred because Walter Reed Army Institute of Research personnel did not follow DoD and Service guidance for preparing a business case analysis.  Specifically they:\n",
      "\n",
      "developed the business case analysis around co-locating and moving the entire HIV Diagnostics and Reference Laboratory and other non-HIV testing elements to a leased facility.  Specifically, WRAIR personnel included non-HIV testing elements in their analysis, which were not related to the problem statement;\n",
      "based the premise of the business case analysis on a research cooperative agreement that could not be used;\n",
      "did not consider three or more courses of action;\n",
      "did not consistently use total costs in their analysis; and\n",
      "used flawed selection criteria in the decision matrix analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, U.S. Army Medical Command personnel cannot ensure that they made the best decision transferring HIV testing from the contractor to the HIV Diagnostics and Reference Laboratory, and may increase costs by moving the laboratory and the other non-HIV mission elements into leased space. However, we determined that the Navy’s plans to transfer Navy HIV testing from a contractor to the Air Force appeared reasonable because using the Air Force for HIV testing instead of the Navy’s current contractor could save the Navy approximately $3.58 million per year.2\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Medical Command, re-perform the business case analysis for HIV testing and ensure the analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "includes only the scope cited in the problem statement;\n",
      "uses accurate assumptions and current information and costs;\n",
      "includes three or more courses of actions and alternatives;\n",
      "consistently uses total costs associated with the project;\n",
      "uses well-defined and measurable alternative selection criteria; and\n",
      "is adequately documented and supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we recommend that the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Medical Command, not enter into any leases to move Army laboratories until the business case analysis is re-performed.  \n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Chief of Staff, U.S. Army Medical Command, agreed with our recommendations and addressed all the specifics of the recommendations.  The Chief of Staff agreed to revise the business case analysis to incorporate the elements in the recommendation.  The Chief of Staff expects to complete the revised business case analysis by June 30, 2017.  In addition, the Chief of Staff agreed not to enter into any new leases until the business case analysis is re-performed.  Therefore, the recommendations are resolved but remain open.  We will close the recommendations once we receive and analyze the revised business case analysis to ensure it contains all elements of our recommendation, and verify that the U.S. Army Medical Command has not entered into any new leases to move Army laboratories.  \n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Army properly recorded foreign currency payments, exchange transactions, and related gains and losses. We also performed internal control reviews, including testing the accuracy of foreign currency payments.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The Army conducts operations overseas, where it is sometimes necessary to make payments using the currency of the host nation instead of the U.S. dollar. Currency exchange rates constantly fluctuate, affecting the U.S. dollar value when making foreign currency payments. The Army records these fluctuations in its disbursing and accounting systems when processing foreign payments. U.S. Army Financial Management Command (USAFMCOM) provides financial oversight to the disbursing offices.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "The Army did not properly record foreign currency payments, fluctuations from exchange transactions, and related gains and losses for four of the five disbursing offices we reviewed. We project that the Army incorrectly recorded 11,173 of 52,632 (21 percent) fluctuation transactions. The projected 11,173 incorrectly recorded transactions had an absolute value of $30 million. Army management did not have procedures in place over their local national employee payroll, disbursing, and vendor pay processes to prevent or identify the inaccuracies. Disbursing offices use a vendor pay process to determine the amount due to a contractor or vendor for all contract or purchase orders.\n",
      "The Army did not properly record foreign currency payments and fluctuation because personnel did not update the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) in 2016 to comply with revised DoD policy to record gains and losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, the Army incorrectly recorded a projected absolute value of $30 million to the foreign currency fluctuation accounts in FY 2016 and first quarter FY 2017. Also, the disbursing offices did not have adequate procedures in place to ensure proper recording of future foreign currency transactions, because Army management did not establish thorough oversight of operations within the vendor pay, disbursing, and local national employee payroll functions. Although we did not find instances of fraud, the Army is at risk for potential losses and reporting of additional financial inaccuracies from undetected errors and fraud, increased interest payments, and payments made for incorrect amounts, as a result of incorrect exchange rates.\n",
      "The Army disbursing officers did not effectively manage the 10 Limited Depositary Checking Accounts (LDAs) used to hold foreign currency that we reviewed. Of the 10 LDAs, 8 maintained balances that were $126.5 million higher than the approved cash holding authority limit, and 6 of those 10 held a total of $112.1 million more than the 7-day supply of funds limit. Additionally, Disbursing Office personnel from the Army 176th Financial Management Support Unit (FMSU) did not protect sensitive financial information of Korean Nationals when processing payments through the LDA. Because of ineffective management of the LDAs, the disbursing offices held cash in excess of immediate needs. In addition, the Army recorded additional gains and losses on the value of the excess funds, and the DoD is at risk of future losses due to unfavorable fluctuations in the value of the excess foreign currency. Furthermore, 176th FMSU personnel placed bank accounts for affected Korean National personnel and contractors at risk to unauthorized access.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend the Commander, 176th FMSU, U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, South Korea, revise the standard operating procedures for the disbursing process; develop and implement an approval process for all currency exchanges; develop and implement procedures to safeguard sensitive financial information; and ensure the disbursing office has taken all possible actions to transmit payment files securely. \n",
      "We recommend that the Director, Army Finance and Accounting Service – Korea, ensure the vendor pay office fully implements new procedures to track invoices received and verify funds are available for payment. \n",
      "We recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer (ODCFO) issue guidance on DoD standard general ledger transactions for Components. Once issued, we recommend that the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Operations) (DASA[FO]) update the Army accounting systems as required by the DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR). \n",
      "We recommend that the Director, 266th Financial Management Support Center (FMSC), develop guidance to require periodic reviews of system accesses for finance office personnel and ensure adequate separation of duties; develop procedures to maintain alternate certifying officials for each payment system; implement controls to ensure the Italy Finance Office maintains proper separation of duties; ensure senior management is directly involved in oversight of the payroll process; develop a plan to replace the current Italian Local National Payroll System with a system that meets Federal requirements. \n",
      "We recommend that the ODCFO revise the DoD FMR to clarify the requirements for managing foreign government contributions (burden sharing funds). Once revised, we recommend that the Commander, 176th FMSU, U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, South Korea; Director, Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)-Japan; and Director, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Finance Center develop local procedures to comply with the DoD FMR. \n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, 176th FMSU, U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan, South Korea; Director, USACE Finance Center; and Director, 266th FMSC adjust the cash holding authorities or reduce the balances of the LDAs to comply with the current cash holding authorities. \n",
      "We recommend that the Director, Army Financial Services, U.S. Army Finance Command (USAFMCOM) verify that quarterly cash verifications determine and report on whether the disbursing officer’s cash balance held at personal risk comply with the cash holding authority letter as required by the DoD FMR.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",

      "Background\n",
      "LOGCAP is an Army program using contractors to provide logistical and sustainment services to deployed forces since 1992. The Army has issued four LOGCAP contracts to provide sustainment support to U.S. operations around the world, including Afghanistan. Services provided in the LOGCAP contract include dining and laundry facilities, housing, construction, transportation, and facilities maintenance. The Army Sustainment Command awarded LOGCAP IV in 2007.\n",
      "In 2009, the Army Contracting Command–Rock Island awarded task orders for LOGCAP services in Afghanistan to DynCorp International for the Southern Afghanistan Area of Responsibility, which includes Kandahar Airfield, and to Fluor Intercontinental for the Northern Afghanistan Area of Responsibility, which includes Bagram Airfield. As part of the transition to LOGCAP IV, the LOGCAP III contractor transferred possession and accountability of GFP to DynCorp and Fluor.\n",
      "Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 45 defines GFP as property in the possession of, or directly acquired by, the Government and subsequently furnished to the contractor for the performance of a contract. \n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of GFP furnished to LOGCAP contractors includes heating and air conditioning units; construction vehicles, such as forklifts; and power generators. \n",
      "The Army Sustainment Command and Army Contracting Command execute GFP and contractor oversight responsibilities through their subordinate commands, the 401st Army Field Support Brigade and the Expeditionary Contracting Command–Afghanistan. The 401st Army Field Support Brigade provides a property book officer responsible for maintaining the Army’s official accountable records for GFP. The Expeditionary Contracting Command–Afghanistan, as the contract administrator, oversees the LOGCAP contractors using administrative contracting officers and property administrators.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "The Army did not perform effective oversight of LOGCAP GFP in Afghanistan. Specifically, the Army Sustainment Command did not include at least 26,993 items provided to the LOGCAP IV contractors in the Army’s accountable records.\n",
      "The Army’s accountable records were incomplete because the Army Contracting Command–Rock Island did not properly modify the LOGCAP IV contract for GFP transfers and did not coordinate GFP transfers with the property book officer. In addition, Army guidance did not include sufficient controls for identifying and resolving GFP accountability deficiencies.\n",
      "As a result of the Army’s poor accountability of LOGCAP GFP in Afghanistan, at least $99.9 million in property was at increased risk of being lost, stolen, or unaccounted for without Army detection. LOGCAP contractors have self-reported more than $9.7 million in GFP losses since 2012. However, without maintaining an accurate list of all GFP, Army officials cannot be certain that all contractor GFP losses have been identified, investigated, and reported. In addition, the contractors’ records contained 4,019 controlled inventory items, valued at $1.5 million, that were not included in the Army’s accountable records. If enemy forces obtain certain controlled inventory items, such as personal protective equipment, they could be used against U.S. and Coalition forces. Finally, the lack of accountability of LOGCAP GFP limited the Army’s ability to plan and execute base sustainment in Afghanistan. Specifically, the Army had to rely on the contractors’ records for procurement-related decision making.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Commanding General, Army Contracting Command, coordinate with the Commander, Expeditionary Contracting Command–Afghanistan, to:\n",
      "• review and validate the contractors’ Government-furnished property listings, modify LOGCAP task orders 0004 and 0005 to ensure all GFP currently possessed by the LOGCAP contractors is included on the contract, and provide the property book officer with the updated contract modification;\n",
      "\n",
      "• develop a GFP training manual and train personnel on the Army guidance and processes for LOGCAP accountability; and\n",
      "\n",
      "• ensure corrective actions implemented on LOGCAP IV are effectively included in the establishment and execution of the LOGCAP V contract. \n",
      "We recommend that the Commanding General, Army Sustainment Command, task the Commander, 401st Army Field Support Brigade, to: \n",
      "• use the contract modification referenced in the first recommendation to update the Army’s official GFP accountable records; and\n",
      "\n",
      "• update the Theater Provided Equipment standard operating procedures to require the theater property book officer coordinate with Expeditionary Contracting Command–Afghanistan to reconcile, at least twice per year, the Army GFP accountable record with the contractors’ records and address any discrepancies.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Deputy to the Commanding General, Army Contracting Command, responding for the Commanding General, Army Contracting Command, agreed with the recommendation to review and validate the contract Government-furnished property listings, modify the task orders accordingly, and provide modifications to the property book officer. In addition, the Deputy agreed to review established procedures and training to ensure that accountability is correctly addressed. Furthermore, the Deputy agreed to ensure corrective actions implemented on LOGCAP IV are effectively included in the establishment and execution of the LOGCAP V contract. Therefore, the recommendations are resolved and will be closed when we verify the planned actions are fully implemented.\n",
      "The Executive Director, Acquisition Integration and Management Center, responding for the Commanding General, Army Sustainment Command, agreed to use the modifications provided by Army Contracting Command to update the Accountable Property System of Record and the fiduciary record. In addition, the Executive Director agreed to update the Theater Provided Equipment standard operating procedures to reflect the intent to conduct semiannual reconciliation of the Government-furnished equipment with the Expeditionary Contracting Command–Afghanistan.

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the U.S. Army (Army) effectively managed its modernization of the H-60 Black Hawk (H-60) helicopter fleet. Specifically, we reviewed the Army’s H-60 new equipment training strategy and airframe condition evaluations.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "The H-60 helicopter is used by the active duty Army, U.S. Army National Guard (Guard), and the U.S. Army Reserve (Reserve). According to Project Manager Utility Helicopters officials, the modernized fleet will consist of 1,375 H-60M helicopters and 760 H-60V helicopters by FY 2035. The H-60M helicopter is the newest helicopter in the H-60 fleet with a digital cockpit and autopilot capabilities. The Army is developing the H-60V helicopters by upgrading the H-60L analog cockpit to a digital cockpit. The H-60V cockpits are expected to be visually identical to the H-60M cockpits and allow an H-60M pilot to fly an H-60V helicopter with limited additional training.\n",
      "New equipment training provides H-60 pilots with information about the helicopter’s use and support requirements. Airframe condition evaluations are annual reviews of the structural parts of the H-60 helicopter. Army policy requires all H-60 helicopters to be evaluated annually for structural defects, unless valid exemptions exist.\n",
      "Findings\n",
      "The Army did not provide adequate funding and training for H-60 pilots on the new equipment. This occurred because Army officials did not agree which Army organization was responsible for funding and conducting H-60 new equipment training. The Army will need $152.9 million more than it has budgeted to provide new equipment training for a total of 1,390 H-60 pilots from FY 2018 through FY 2035. If no action is taken, the Guard will have a shortage of 160 trained H-60 pilots by FY 2026.\n",
      "Additionally, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command officials did not effectively manage airframe condition evaluations for the H-60 fleet. During the annual evaluation period from March 1, 2016, through February 28, 2017, the Army did not conduct an airframe condition evaluation, as required by Army regulation and policy, for 460 of 2,098 H-60 helicopters. This occurred because U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command officials did not provide adequate oversight of the H-60 airframe condition evaluations. Specifically, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command officials did not require an evaluation for all H-60 helicopters or verify that all exemptions were valid, coordinate with unit commanders to ensure all H-60 helicopters were available for evaluation, and require evaluations of H-60 helicopters that were less than 3 years old. Evaluators identified safety problems with some H-60 helicopters that required the unit commander to ground (restrict flying) those helicopters. However, the unit commander did not always allow evaluators to finish the evaluation of additional helicopters because he did not want to ground more helicopters if additional safety problems were identified. As a result, Army pilots and crew could be flying H-60 helicopters with unidentified structural defects, which could impact the life and safety of the helicopter and its crew. Furthermore, Army officials may select the wrong helicopters for maintenance, modernization, or retirement.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Vice Chief of Staff, Army, provide training capacity for new equipment training to all pilots on H-60M and H-60V helicopters. In addition, we recommend that the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) require the Project Management Utility Helicopters to fund H-60M and H-60V new equipment training until all new equipment has been fielded.

      "Furthermore, we recommend that the Project Management Utility Helicopters designate a H-60M and H-60V New Equipment Training Manager and evaluate the impact of funding the new equipment training has on the H-60M and H-60V programs’ costs and update program documentation as needed.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",

Specifically, we reviewed the F-22 Program Office’s implementation of Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). SAFe is a software development method that uses short time periods to develop smaller portions of software that contribute to the final product.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The Air Force F-22 is a fighter aircraft that incorporates stealth capability in the performance of air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. In 2003, the Air Force established a modernization program to add enhanced capabilities. The Air Force divided the F-22 modernization program into 10 separate programs, with each providing multiple capabilities that included both hardware and software development. The Program Office used several software development methods for F-22 modernization. These methods resulted in the identification of numerous deficiencies late in development and correction of the deficiencies required additional software updates. This also led to F-22 modernization schedule delays to allow time to complete the testing on the additional updates. To identify deficiencies quicker and deliver capabilities faster, the Program Office implemented agile software development methods on future F-22 modernization. Agile Software development methods use close collaboration, and frequent delivery of software updates. The Program Office specifically chose to use an agile software development method known as SAFe.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "The U.S. Air Force did not effectively manage the modernization of the F-22 Raptor fleet. Specifically, the Program Office did not update its contracting strategy for SAFe implementation on F-22 modernization programs. This occurred because Program Office officials have not identified the appropriate contracting strategy to best incentivize the contractor when using SAFe. In addition, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Acquisition have not issued policy for implementing agile software development methods on weapon system acquisitions. As a result, without an appropriate contracting strategy, the Program Office may not deliver F-22 modernized capabilities necessary to sustain air superiority against rapidly evolving U.S. adversaries.\n",

      "Background:\n",
      "NAVFAC Pacific provides acquisition services to the Pacific area of responsibility through subordinate commands, including Naval Facilities Engineering Command Marianas (NAVFACMAR) in Guam. According to NAVFACMAR, NAVFAC Pacific is the procuring authority—soliciting and awarding BOSS contracts for naval operations in the region. Also, according to NAVFACMAR, NAVFACMAR is the administrative authority—presiding over the daily contract operations while providing contractor oversight for NAVFAC contracts in Guam.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "NAVFACMAR adequately monitored contractor performance and conducted sufficient invoice reviews for goods and services provided under the Guam BOSS contract from April 1, 2016, through March 31, 2017. Specifically, NAVFACMAR:\n",

      "NAVFACMAR adequately monitored contractor performance and conducted sufficient invoice reviews because it took corrective actions in response to recommendations made in a 2013 Naval Audit Service report. Specifically, NAVFACMAR updated and implemented policies and procedures related to contractor performance assessments and invoice reviews, and established controls and provided training on appropriate contractor performance and cost oversight. The corrective actions NAVFACMAR took in response to the recommendations improved contractor oversight and ensured that the contractor was performing in accordance with the Guam BOSS contract terms and conditions and that the contractor was paid correctly. NAVFAC has awarded multiple BOSS contracts around the world that are managed by other NAVFAC regions. Those contracts could benefit from the robust oversight structure NAVFACMAR has implemented in Guam.\n",

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the Combined Security Transition Command–Afghanistan (CSTC-A) provided effective oversight of ammunition for the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). Specifically, we focused on ammunition that was procured by DoD and provided to the ANDSF.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "In 2011, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer authorized CSTC-A to provide Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) resources directly to the Afghan Ministry of Interior (MoI) and Ministry of Defense (MoD) (ministries) to sustain the ANDSF. The goal of this support is to develop ministerial capability and capacity in the areas of budget development and execution, payment of salaries, acquisition planning, and procurement.\n",
      "CSTC-A is the DoD command that directs U.S. efforts to organize, train, and equip the ANDSF. The command provides oversight and ensures adequate controls are in place to safeguard appropriated ASFF direct contributions provided to the ministries.\n",
      "The MoI manages the Afghan National Police (ANP), and the MoD manages the Afghan National Army (ANA). The ministries develop, validate, and justify requirements for their annual budget, including the use of ASFF direct contributions. CSTC-A and the ministries sign annual Bilateral Financial Commitment Letters in which CSTC-A commits to funding specified portions of each ministry’s budget and the ministries commit to stated conditions to ensure continued funding.\n",
      "CSTC-A uses inventory and consumption reports from the ministries to track MoI and MoD ammunition demand, identify ammunition requirements, and determine when to procure ammunition. We focused on performance requirements as agreed to in the FY 1395 commitment letters.1\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "CSTC-A did not provide effective oversight of ammunition that was procured by the DoD and provided to the ANDSF. CSTC-A officials stated that they could not perform physical inspections beyond the corps or zone level to validate ministry-provided ammunition reports due to understaffing and security limitations. Therefore, CSTC-A limited its oversight to evaluating monthly consumption and inventory reports that the ministries agreed to provide in the commitment letters. Specifically, CSTC-A did not:\n",
      "\n",
      "define the roles and responsibilities of the CSTC-A personnel responsible for evaluating ministry ammunition reporting,\n",
      "define the criteria necessary to objectively evaluate the ministries’ ammunition reporting, and\n",
      "obtain and review the Ministry Inspectors General inspection results of each ministry’s on-hand ammunition inventories when assessing the accuracy of ammunition reports provided by the ministries.\n",
      "\n",
      "This occurred because CSTC-A focused on its advisory mission through mentoring Afghan officials but did not develop an effective strategy to oversee the ministries’ compliance with commitment letter requirements.\n",
      "In addition, CSTC-A only enforced one penalty during FY 1395, even though CSTC-A determined the ministries did not meet the commitment letter reporting requirements on 36 of 55 assessments. This occurred because CSTC-A officials believed enforcing penalties outlined in the commitment letter would have a negative effect on ANDSF operational readiness.\n",
      "Without consistent, timely, and accurate reporting from the ministries, CSTC-A cannot account for all ammunition consumed by the ANDSF. In addition, since CSTC-A was unable to verify the ministries’ consumption data, CSTC-A does not have assurance that the $702 million spent to procure ammunition in FYs 2015 and 2016 supported actual requirements and was used for its intended purposes.2 Finally, without accurate consumption data, future ammunition requirements may not be valid.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Commanding General, Combined Security Transition Command–Afghanistan develop and document a long-term strategy to improve the ministries’ ammunition reporting that includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the personnel involved with providing oversight of ammunition,\n",
      "criteria to evaluate the ministries’ compliance with ammunition commitment letter requirements, and\n",
      "procedures to review Ministry Inspectors General inspection results when assessing the accuracy of ammunition reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, include consequences in the FY 1397 commitment letters for the ministries’ noncompliance that would not impact operational readiness and Combined Security Transition Command–Afghanistan would be willing to consistently enforce.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff Security Assistance, Combined Security Transition Command–Afghanistan (CSTC-A), responding for the Commanding General, CSTC-A, stated the report was factually accurate. However, the Chief of Staff did not state whether the command agreed or disagreed with the recommendation.\n",
      "The Chief of Staff did provide a list of planned actions to improve oversight of ammunition. Specifically, the Chief of Staff stated that the command has revised its Ammunition Stockholding Policy to include clear lines of responsibility for ammunition accountability and issue. In addition, the Chief of Staff stated that CSTC-A will establish an Integrated Process Team to develop an action plan that will provide appropriate ammunition oversight with existing resources and authorities. Further, the Chief of Staff stated the current commitment letters include penalties associated with ammunition reporting. In addition, the Chief of Staff stated the Commanding General, CSTC-A, determines the applicability of the penalties and that penalties had been assessed in the past for non-reporting. However, the Chief of Staff did not address efforts to develop criteria to evaluate the ministries’ compliance with commitment letter requirements or procedures for reviewing Ministry Inspectors General inspection results when assessing the accuracy of ammunition reports. In addition, the Chief of Staff did not address the recommendation to include consequences in the FY 1397 commitment letters that would not impact ANDSF operational readiness and that CSTC-A would be willing to enforce.\n",
      "The recommendation is unresolved and remains open. We request that the Commanding General, CSTC-A, provide the Ammunition Stockholding Policy for our review and also provide additional comments on developing criteria to evaluate the ministries’ compliance with commitment letter requirements and procedures for assessing the accuracy of ammunition reports.

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DeCA officials awarded a $55.1 million contract with an effective date of November 2015, to provide produce to 25 commissaries in Japan and South Korea. The prime contractor awarded two subcontracts to provide support for the produce contract—one for Japan in June 2016 and one for South Korea in July 2016.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "In April 2017, the prime contractor transferred the South Korea part of the prime contract to the South Korea subcontractor, and DeCA officials awarded a new contract to support South Korea produce operations. Additionally, in September 2017, the prime contractor transferred the Japan part of the contract to the Japan subcontractor, and DeCA officials awarded a new contract to support Japan produce operations. As a result, there were separate produce contracts for Japan and for South Korea.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Japan included one for mainland Japan and one for Okinawa. Additionally, DeCA personnel were required to report non-conforming produce on a produce inspection worksheet; and request a price adjustment or credit for the non-conforming produce that is carried forward to the total voucher payment. Non-conforming produce are defective in appearance and do not meet contract quality requirements. Further, the produce contract required a 98-percent fill rate, which DeCA personnel calculated for each delivery by comparing the number of produce cases ordered to the number of produce cases the contractors delivered.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DeCA officials did not provide effective oversight of the produce contracts for Japan and South Korea. Specifically, DeCA personnel did not verify produce prices for 35 high-volume core items on the surveys submitted by the contractors. High-volume core items, established by the contracts, are mainstream produce items in the typical American diet, such as apples, bananas, carrots, and tomatoes. This occurred because DeCA did not have policies and procedures defining how the personnel should oversee the surveys. Additionally, DeCA personnel did not receive training on the contractual survey requirements. As a result, commissary customers may not have received the required contractual savings amount for produce because DeCA officials did not know whether the contractors met the price savings requirements. The contracts required that 35 high-volume core items cost customers 30 percent less than local Japanese market prices and 34 percent less than local South Korean market prices. In May 2017, we reviewed the contractor’s Japan survey and identified price savings were only 13.9 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DeCA personnel also did not accurately calculate credits for non-conforming produce on 29 of 84 produce inspection worksheets we reviewed. This occurred because DeCA officials did not verify that information supporting the credits—including the case price, pack size, cases received, units received, percent case credited, and amount to be credited—was correct before processing voucher payments on the contracts. As a result, 27 vouchers submitted for payment, valued at $2.5 million, were not fully supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, DeCA personnel did not accurately calculate fill rate percentages. This occurred because DeCA did not have policies and procedures defining how personnel should calculate contract fill rates or policies and procedures requiring personnel to verify fill rate calculations. As a result, commissary customers may not have had the opportunity to purchase the quantity and variety of produce required under the contract. Additionally, officials used inaccurate fill rates to document contract performance, which resulted in incorrect daily fill rate reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to these findings, we observed security concerns with produce storage and transportation during a site visit to the Japan food storage warehouse in May 2017. Specifically, we identified that the main gate was unlocked and open, no one checked identification, and storage coolers did not have controlled access and were not locked. Trucks delivering produce did not have any security seals to deter unwanted entry and monitor driver access. The doors had only a lock on the door and the driver controlled the key. Air Force regulations state that, to mitigate introduction of contaminants into the food supply chain, agencies should incorporate seals on locked containers. As a result, produce could become contaminated and DeCA officials have no assurance that the contractor maintained chain of custody during transportation.\n",

      "Finding:\n",
      "We determined that DCMA contracting officials did not properly award 11 of the 14 IT service contracts reviewed, valued at $61 million.  Specifically, DCMA officials did not:\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition, DCMA officials used flexible ordering agreements to award 5 of the 14 contracts, which violated relevant Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements.  \n",
      "These problems occurred because DCMA officials did not ensure that contracts were developed in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation and DCMA guidance, use multi-functional teams to plan and manage IT service requirements, and perform pre- or post-award peer reviews of contracts. \n",
      "As a result, DCMA contracting officials acquired $56.4 million in IT services on contracts with poorly defined or nonexistent performance work statements that may not meet the performance needs required to successfully execute the DCMA mission.  Additionally, DCMA contracting officials fulfilled IT services requirements under the 8(a) Business Development Program without the Small Business Administration determining whether the requirements should continue under the 8(a) program.  Furthermore, DCMA contracting officers exceeded their authority by establishing flexible ordering agreements and did not comply with Federal competition guidelines. \n",
      "In addition, DCMA contracting officials did not properly administer IT service contracts for 13 of the 14 contracts, valued at $70.3 million.  Specifically, DCMA officials did not properly monitor contractor performance, accept IT services, approve invoices or use the Defense Contract Audit Agency to approve interim invoices with labor-hour line items.  This occurred because DCMA officials did not:\n",

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the Defense Health Agency (DHA) developed controls to identify health care pharmaceutical payments at high risk of fraud or abuse. We focused on controls to prevent and detect potentially fraudulent or abusive claims for pharmaceuticals. The DHA defines “abuse” as any practice that is inconsistent with accepted practice which results in a claim, unnecessary costs, or payment for services or supplies not medically necessary and appropriate, or that fail to meet professionally recognized standards for health care providers. “ Abuse” includes deception or misrepresentation by a provider in relation to a TRICARE claim. We also reviewed the process for approving and implementing new controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "The DHA is responsible for ensuring the effective implementation of the DoD Pharmacy benefit, taking into consideration beneficiary satisfaction, cost effectiveness, and evidence-based best practices. DHA personnel analyze claims data to identify rising pharmacy costs and develop controls, such as prior authorization requirements or quantity limits, to contain rising costs. Prior authorization controls require the health care provider to validate the need for a specific drug before approval of a prescription claim and quantity limit controls restrict the beneficiary to a maximum amount of a drug unless a health care provider certifies that the beneficiary requires additional quantities.\n",
      "In May 2015, in response to rapidly increasing costs for compound drugs, the DHA implemented an expedited process to place new prior authorization requirements for drugs used as compound ingredients. Compound drugs result from combining or altering two or more ingredients to create a customized medication. As a result of the new requirements, costs for compound drug claims dropped from $497 million in April 2015 to $10 million in June 2015. In addition, the DHA reported in 2016 it recovered over $106 million in civil settlements and criminal judgments due to compound drug fraud.\n",
      "The prior authorization requirements for compound ingredients did not apply to individual drugs when not used in a compound. We initiated this audit to determine if DHA had adequate controls to identify individual drugs at high risk of fraud or abuse and prevent potential losses like those that occurred with compound drugs.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) properly prepared, executed, and accounted for reimbursable agreements. We performed this audit in response to a request from DHRA management that we review active reimbursable agreements, as of December 31, 2016, where the DHRA was the service provider.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The DHRA provides goods and services, such as providing common access cards, language translation services, and commercial travel support, to Federal organizations through reimbursable agreements.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "Although DHRA personnel correctly prepared 9 of 45 reimbursable agreements, they did not adequately prepare the remaining 36 reimbursable agreements, valued at $ 207.4 million. In addition, DHRA personnel did not perform the required annual review for 27 of the 32 reimbursable agreements that were at least 1 year old and did not perform the required triennial review of all 10 reimbursable agreements that were more than 3 years old. This occurred because DHRA management did not effectively oversee DHRA reimbursable programs by developing and implementing procedures for preparing and reviewing reimbursable agreements.\n",
      "As a result, DHRA management could not demonstrate that all active reimbursable agreements were adequately prepared to confirm that the DHRA had the appropriate legal and funding authority. \n",
      "In addition, DHRA personnel did not properly execute DHRA reimbursable agreements, resulting in potential Antideficiency Act violations. This occurred because DHRA personnel did not request reimbursement from the Military Services and Defense Agencies for all reimbursable costs. This also occurred because DHRA management did not have procedures to review reimbursable programs to identify and streamline unnecessarily complex funding and reimbursement processes. \n",
      "Furthermore, DHRA personnel did not accurately account for DHRA reimbursable agreements in a timely manner. This occurred because:\n",
      "• DHRA management did not have procedures to record accounts payable and expense \n",
      "   transactions in the reporting periods when services were provided;\n",
      "• DHRA management did not coordinate with Defense Finance and Accounting Service–\n",
      "   Columbus to ensure the DHRA had the procedures necessary to record corresponding \n",
      "   revenues and expenses in the same reporting period; and\n",
      "• DHRA management did not maintain a centralized database to retain and readily retrieve \n",
      "   reimbursable agreements and related funding documents and did not have the infrastructure \n",
      "   to provide supporting documentation in a timely manner.\n",
      " \n",
      "As a result, DHRA management did not have the complete and accurate financial information needed to oversee the DHRA’s reimbursable programs and prevent: (1) inaccurate financial reporting, (2) incorrect use of direct appropriated and reimbursable funds, (3) expenditure of funds in excess of available reimbursable funds, and (4) reimbursable processes that were not cost-effective.\n",
      "During this audit, DHRA management implemented new procedures to correct the preparation deficiencies and identified the need for additional procedures to resolve the execution and accounting deficiencies. However, because they only recently implemented them, DHRA personnel could not demonstrate the operating effectiveness of these procedures.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Director, DHRA:\n",
      "• implement procedures to review reimbursable agreements in accordance with DoD guidance,\n",
      "• complete a preliminary review of the potential Antideficiency Act violations within 14 weeks \n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) Europe within the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) properly awarded telecommunication service contracts. We reviewed 30 contracts, valued at $64.5 million, awarded from October 1, 2014, through May 31, 2017. \n",
      "The United States Court of Federal Claims referred information to the DoD Office of Inspector General on one DISA telecommunication service contract that we included in our sample, and the specific details of the request and our review of that contract are included in Appendix B.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "We focused our audit on contracts awarded by DITCO Europe to address follow up questions identified by the United States Court of Federal Claims related to a contract the court referred for our review. The Court found that DITCO Europe did not exercise due diligence when awarding the contract and requested that we review why the contracting officer awarded the contract at a price of $38.6 million more than the lowest priced but unsuccessful offeror. We reviewed an additional 29 telecommunication service contracts awarded by DITCO Europe to determine whether similar problems existed with the award process. \n",
      "DISA is responsible for purchasing telecommunication services for the DoD. DITCO, a component of DISA, provides the contracting support to acquire telecommunications services. These services are obtained under communication service authorizations, which are contracts used solely for the acquisition of telecommunication services.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "We determined that DITCO Europe contracting personnel properly awarded 30 telecommunication service contracts, valued at $64.5 million. We considered the contract awards proper if there was adequate evidence to support that DITCO Europe contracting personnel ensured acquisition planning, competition, and execution of the designated acquisition strategy were in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). However, DITCO Europe contracting personnel did not consistently apply FAR requirements for market research, contract file documentation and source selection. Specifically, DITCO Europe contracting personnel:\n",
      "\n",
      "Did not adequately conduct or document market research in accordance with the FAR for 18 of 24 contracts. This occurred because DITCO Europe contracting personnel used their comprehensive knowledge and ongoing associations with the telecommunication providers in Europe to identify potential contractors. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did not ensure contact files contained the required documentation to constitute a complete history of the transaction in accordance with the FAR for 16 of the 30 contracts. This occurred because the Integrated Defense Enterprise Acquisition System (IDEAS) builds and maintains the contract files; however, IDEAS uploads files as text files and does not always include the same level of detail as other available documentation that could be manually uploaded. Additionally, DITCO Europe contracting personnel experience latency problems when uploading files to IDEAS, and in some cases the files failed to upload. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Did not ensure telecommunication providers provided evidence of National Long Lines Agency (NALLA) accreditation as required in the solicitation, thereby violating the FAR for 11 of 19 contracts. This occurred because DITCO Europe contracting personnel made it standard practice to perform the NALLA accreditation check themselves on behalf of the contractors.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, DITCO Europe contracting personnel cannot support that they conducted market research before soliciting offers and could not demonstrate that all contract requirements and decisions were fully supported throughout the contract file. Additionally, while the deficiencies did not affect award decisions, not following the requirements of the FAR pertaining to the award of telecommunication service contracts and not enforcing NALLA accreditation may increase the risk of award protests and litigation. \n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "During the audit, DITCO updated its procedures to address our concerns regarding the verification of NALLA accreditation, and no recommendation was necessary. \n",
      "We recommend that the Director, DISA, in coordination with the Director, Procurement Services Directorate, DITCO, provide refresher training to contracting personnel on conducting market research and fully documenting contract files in accordance with the FAR.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "The DITCO Procurement Services Directorate Director, responding on behalf of the DISA Director, agreed with our recommendation to provide refresher training to contracting personnel related to FAR requirements for market research and maintaining contract files. The Director stated that DITCO Europe developed market research templates to upload into the contract files before solicitation effective February 1, 2018, and instructed all team members on January 23, 2018, to incorporate the market research reports into IDEAS. The Director also stated that the Procurement Services Directorate will work with the IDEAS Change Advisory Board to ensure files uploaded to IDEAS capture necessary information, and planned to have this effort completed in the third quarter FY 2018. Lastly, the Director stated that contracting support staff received training in January 2018 to file contract documentation in the IDEAS official contract files. Therefore, the recommendation is resolved but will remain open. We will close this recommendation once we receive evidence of the newly developed market research template and instruction to use the reports, implementation of the solution to ensure IDEAS files capture necessary information, and the training provided to staff to file required documentation in the official contract files.\n",

      "We determined whether the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) complied with Federal and DoD mandatory processes for software life cycle management of the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS).1 Specifically, we addressed Defense Hotline allegations by determining whether DISA was effectively following Federal and DoD policies and procedures for defining software development requirements, using open source software, performing software testing, and ensuring software security.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "The Defense Hotline received allegations stating that DISA failed to comply with Federal and DoD processes for software management. The allegations focused on the DCS and outlined concerns of potential software security vulnerabilities. The allegations included concerns that DISA officials were not following Federal and DoD policy for defining software development requirements, using open source software, performing software testing, and ensuring software security.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "We did not substantiate the Defense Hotline allegations related to inadequate software development requirements, lack of adherence to DoD Chief Information Officer direction for open source software use, and inadequate software testing and security. DISA officials complied with Federal and DoD guidance for management of the DCS. Specifically, DISA officials:\n",

      "Although we did not substantiate the Defense Hotline allegations, we determined that the authorizing official granted DISA a 1-year authorization to operate (ATO) instead of a full 3-year ATO in May 2016.2 The authorizing official grants the ATO based on the level of risk to organizational operations. If overall risk is determined to be acceptable, and there are no noncompliant controls with a high or very high level of risk,3 a 3 -year ATO can be granted. If overall risk is determined to be acceptable due to mission criticality, but there are noncompliant controls with a high or very high level of risk, a 1-year ATO with conditions can be granted by the authorizing official with permission of the responsible Component Chief Information Officer. After the 1-year period, if noncompliant controls with a high or very high level of risk still exist, the authorizing official may again grant a 1-year ATO with conditions only if the Component Chief Information Officer grants permission. If the risk for the high or very high noncompliant controls is mitigated to an acceptable risk level, a full 3-year ATO can be granted.\n",
      "DISA needs to mitigate the level of risk for high and very high noncompliant controls and obtain a 3-year ATO for the DCS. Mitigating the level of risk for these noncompliant controls will improve security of the DCS and further decrease the risk of unauthorized access.\n",
      "Recommendation\n",

      "Management Actions Taken\n",
      "We provided a discussion draft with the finding and recommendation of this report to DISA on February 27, 2017. DISA agreed and had no substantive comments on the discussion draft. Therefore, we did not require a written response, and are publishing this report in final form.\n",

      "We consider the DCS program manager’s response to have addressed all specifics of the recommendation; therefore, the recommendation is resolved but remains open. We will close the recommendation once DISA provides us with a copy of the 2017 ATO for the DCS indicating that the level of risk for high and very high noncompliant controls were mitigated and the authorizing official granted a 3-year ATO.\n",

      "For 16 CSAs, DITCO contracting personnel did not maintain adequate contract files. In addition, for 19 CSAs, DISA’s charges to the customer exceeded disbursements to the vendor and DITCO personnel did not return excess funds to the customers or remedy vendor underpayments in a timely manner.\n",
      "These problems occurred because DITCO contracting personnel did not follow Federal and DoD regulations and internal guidance for awarding and administering contracts. Additionally, DITCO contracting personnel focused on awarding new service contracts and not managing and overseeing existing CSAs.\n",
      "By allowing expired CSAs to continue after the performance period ended, DITCO contracting personnel did not ensure that a valid need still existed for the services provided by the CSA or that the DoD received the best value through competition. For example, the DoD continued to pay for services on one expired CSA for nearly five years after the military base closed. CSA customers were also left vulnerable to cost fluctuation, substantial price increases, and possible loss of services because a valid contract no longer existed. Consequently, the DoD made at least $80.9 million in improper payments on expired CSAs, and $3.3 million could have better supported the warfighter if funds were returned prior to expiration.\n",

      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Vice Director, DISA, responding on behalf of the Director, DISA, agreed with our recommendations to review expired and soon-to-expire CSAs, implement system improvements, improve standard procedures, and determine whether payments on expired CSAs should be recovered. The Vice Director stated that DISA was aggressively working a comprehensive list of expired and soon-to-expire CSAs and had reduced the number of expired CSAs from 10,000 in 2012 to 986 as of July 2017.\n",
      "The Vice Director stated that a new CSA management module will emphasize that contracting officers must discontinue services if they have not received a customer re-award request or justification. The Vice Director also stated that the module will enhance customer notifications, will provide customers with an expiration and suspense date for completing a review and revalidation of the requirements, and will be more convenient for its customers.\n",
      "The Vice Director further stated that the CSA management module will be fielded in the second quarter of FY 2018 and that DISA will coordinate with the Office of General Counsel on recovering any identified improper payments. Therefore, Recommendations 1.a, 1.b, 1.c.1-4, 1.d.1-4, and 1.e are resolved but will remain open until we verify that the comprehensive review has been completed, the number of expired CSAs has been reduced, and that the module is operational and the improper payment review has been completed.\n",
      "The Director, Procurement Services Directorate, DITCO, agreed with our recommendations to improve procedures for its contracting personnel. The Director stated the revised procedures and new weekly billing reconciliation will identify excess funds and provide guidance on reviewing the accuracy of contract obligation amounts.

      "The Acting Principal Deputy, responding on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), agreed and stated that the DoD CIO will continue coordinating with DISA and DITCO on validating CSAs and providing guidance to its customers. The Acting Principal Deputy stated that the DoD Chief Information Officer will partner with the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and DoD Components to reinforce policy requiring customers to inform DISA of actions on reviewing, revalidating, and terminating services.

      "\n",
      "validated contractor-claimed energy savings on elect ESPCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "ESPCs provide a way for the private sector to finance Federal Government energy‑saving projects. The ESPC is a contract type, through which an energy services contractor designs, finances, acquires, installs, and maintains energy‑saving equipment and systems for a Federal agency. ESPCs allow Federal agencies to procure energy savings and facility improvements with no upfront capital costs or special appropriations from Congress. \n",
      "An ESPC consists of two phases—the construction phase and the performance phase. During the construction phase, the energy savings contractor constructs the energy conservation measures, such as lighting improvements, and heating and air conditioning replacements. At the conclusion of the construction phase, the contractor submits a post-installation report to summarize construction phase actions and outcomes, and identify any energy savings achieved during the phase. The performance phase begins once the contractor installs and the Government accepts the energy conservation measures. During the performance phase, the contractor operates and maintains energy improvements, measures the energy savings, and submits measurement and verification reports in accordance with the ESPC. The reports outline the calculation of energy savings and any other evaluation of costs and savings needed to determine the guarantee of savings. The agency is responsible for ESPC administration for the entire term of the ESPC. \n",
      "DLA-Energy, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, performs the contract management functions for 11 ESPCs, valued at $992.8 million, at selected Army, Air Force, and Defense agency bases. We reviewed 10 of the 11 ESPCs, valued at $343.5 million, to determine whether DLA-Energy properly solicited and awarded the ESPCs.1 \n",
      "Seven of the 10 projects, valued at $240.7 million, were in the performance phase. With the assistance of base-level Department of Public Works (DPW) officials, DLA-Energy oversees the contractor during both the construction and performance phases of the ESPC. \n",
      "We reviewed the seven DLA-Energy performance‑phase ESPCs to determine whether DLA-Energy and the base-level DPW officials verified that the energy savings reported in the contractor’s post-installation and measurement and verification reports were accurate, and that Government payments to the contractor did not exceed the verified savings. \n",
      "We nonstatistically selected five performance-phase ESPCs, valued at $117.8 million, to determine whether DLA-Energy and the base-level DPW officials performed onsite oversight of the ESPCs. The five ESPCs were located at Fort Hood, Texas, and Fort Hamilton, New York.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "DLA-Energy contracting officials maintained competition in soliciting and awarding the 10 ongoing ESPCs. In addition, DLA-Energy contracting and base‑level DPW officials properly administered four of seven ESPCs we reviewed by appointing contracting officer’s representatives and validating contractor‑claimed energy savings.\n",
      "However, DLA-Energy contracting and base-level DPW officials did not:\n",
      "\n",
      "document the validation of the contractor claimed energy savings in 2 of 52 measurement and verification reports that supported a total of $0.9 million in contract payments, and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "resolve a disagreement between DLA-Energy contracting and base-level DPW officials regarding whether the contractor sufficiently supported $1.8 million in contractor-claimed energy savings in the Fort Hamilton Delivery Order No.2 post-installation report. \n",
      "\n",
      "This occurred because DLA-Energy contracting officials had not established written standard operating procedures on the Federal Energy Management Program requirements for awarding and administering ESPCs. As a result, three performance-phase ESPC projects included $2.7 million in questionable contract payments that do not fully comply with Federal ESPC statutory requirements. Furthermore, if DLA-Energy does not maintain standard operating procedures to implement Federal Energy Management Program guidance for ESPCs, DLA-Energy contracting officials may implement inconsistent oversight of ESPCs when validating contractor-claimed savings and overseeing the maintenance, repair, and replacement of energy conservation measures.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the DLA-Energy Commander direct DLA-Energy contracting officials to validate ESPC contractor-claimed energy savings achieved for one ESPC (SPO600-03-F-8274) at Fort Hood, Texas, and two ESPCs (SPO600-02-F-8257 and SPO600-15-F-8001) at Fort Hamilton, New York. We also recommend that the Commander direct the contracting officials, based on the result of the validations, as mandated by law, to take appropriate contractual action (if necessary), such as recovering unrealized guaranteed energy savings or buying out the remaining portion of the applicable contracts. \n",
      "In addition, we recommend that the DLA-Energy Commander consider developing standard operating procedures regarding implementing Federal Energy Management Program guidance regarding solicitation, competition, award, and monitoring of ESPCs. We also recommend that DLA-Energy implement a standard operating procedure to resolve internal Government disagreements over contractor-claimed energy savings.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The DLA Acquisition Deputy Director, responding for the DLA-Energy Commander, agreed or partially agreed with six recommendations and disagreed with one recommendation. Specifically, the DLA Acquisition Deputy Director:\n",
      "\n",
      "agreed with recommendations to validate contractor-claimed energy savings achieved for one ESPC each at Fort Hood and Fort Hamilton and provided documentation showing recently completed validations. Therefore, we have closed these two recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "partially agreed with the recommendation to validate a second Fort Hamilton ESPC (SPO600-15-F-8001), noting that the DLA contracting officer, the contractor, and Fort Hamilton base-level DPW officials were in continuing discussion to modify the ESPC to improve contractor-claimed energy savings methodology, if necessary. We will close this recommendation once DLA-Energy officials have provided the results of the discussions and issued a contract modification, if required. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "partially agreed with the two recommendations to consider developing standard operating procedures regarding the award and administration of ESPCs and the validation of contractor claimed energy savings. The DLA Acquisition Deputy Director stated that the DLA considered developing standard operating procedures to Federal energy Management Program ESPC guidance for solicitation, competition, award, and monitoring of ESPCs, but concluded that supplemental DLA procedures were unnecessary. DLA-Energy remains the exception among DoD Components in operating an ESPC program without standard operating procedures. We request additional comments from the DLA-Energy Commander as to why further DLA-Energy Commander as to why further DLA-Energy policy for award and administration of DLA ESPCs are unnecessary. Therefore, we consider these recommendations to be unresolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "disagreed with the recommendation to implement a standard operating procedure to resolve internal Government disagreements. However, the Deputy Director noted, as of October 2017, DLA-Energy issued an Interagency Agreement with requiring activities that included language to have Government parties resolve any dispute through consultation and escalation, as needed, within their respective organizations. We verified that the agreements included language to resolve Government disagreements; therefore, we have closed the recommendation. \n",

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) personnel complied with the Berry Amendment and the Buy American Act when they purchased covered items such as food, clothing, tents, textiles, and hand or measuring tools.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "We performed this audit in response to Section 1601 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2014.1  To determine whether DLA personnel complied with the Berry Amendment and the Buy American Act, we reviewed a nonstatistical sample of 88 contracts with an obligated value of $386.9 million, out of 2,382 contracts across DLA with an obligated value of $700.4 million, awarded from October 1, 2014, through March 31, 2016. The Berry Amendment directs DoD personnel to ensure funds appropriated or otherwise available to the DoD are not used to procure covered items if the items were not grown, reprocessed, reused, or produced in the United States. The Buy American Act requires, with certain exceptions, that only articles, materials, and supplies that were mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States are used to fulfill Federal procurement and construction contracts.\n",
      "Findings\n",
      "DLA contracting personnel complied with the Berry Amendment for 13 of the 32 contracts reviewed. However, DLA personnel at 3 of the 4 contracting offices visited did not comply with the Berry Amendment for the remaining 19 contracts, valued at $453.2 million.2\n",
      "Specifically, for 14 of the 19 noncompliant contracts, DLA contracting personnel at DLA Troop Support Philadelphia and DLA Aviation Richmond omitted the Berry Amendment implementing clause because they: were unfamiliar with the Berry Amendment, relied on their contract writing system, relied on another official to prepare and review the contract before award, or committed an administrative error. For four noncompliant contracts, contracting personnel at DLA Troop Support Philadelphia did not prepare award notices containing required language to notify the public of the purchase of nondomestic items because they were unaware of the requirement and mistakenly relied on DLA’s electronic contracting systems to include the information or they misinterpreted the requirement and believed that it did not apply. For one of these contracts, DLA Troop Support Philadelphia contracting personnel also purchased foreign-made items without the required supporting documentation and approval because they misinterpreted the Berry Amendment requirements. Contracting personnel at DLA Maritime Puget Sound purchased items containing nondomestic components on the remaining noncompliant contract without the required supporting documentation and approval because they improperly applied an exception to waive the Berry Amendment requirements.\n",
      "As a result, contracting personnel at DLA Troop Support Philadelphia and DLA Aviation Richmond had limited assurance that purchased items complied with the Berry Amendment and suppliers may have provided nondomestic items. In addition, DLA Troop Support Philadelphia personnel did not notify the public regarding a lack of domestically-produced items, and contracting personnel at DLA Troop Support Philadelphia and DLA Maritime Puget Sound committed potential violations of the Antideficiency Act.3\n",
      "DLA personnel at the three contracting offices visited4 complied with the Buy American Act for 44 of the 56 contracts reviewed but did not comply for the 12 remaining contracts, valued at $1.8 million.\n",
      "DLA contracting personnel at DLA Troop Support Philadelphia and DLA Aviation Richmond omitted the Buy American Act implementing clause because they relied on their contract writing system or because of an administrative error. In addition, DLA Aviation Richmond contracting personnel purchased non-U.S.-manufactured items on one contract because they erroneously awarded a small business set-aside contract to an ineligible foreign manufacturer.\n",
      "As a result, contracting personnel at DLA Troop Support Philadelphia and DLA Aviation Richmond had limited assurance that items purchased on 12 contracts complied with the Buy American Act and suppliers may have provided nondomestic items.\n",
      "Corrective Actions Taken\n",
      "Contracting personnel at DLA Troop Support Philadelphia and DLA Aviation Richmond corrected some of the deficiencies identified during the audit. Specifically, DLA contracting personnel modified all 14 Berry Amendment contracts and modified 1 of the 12 Buy American Act contracts with the required implementing clause. In addition, DLA Aviation Richmond contracting personnel issued a local notice to reinforce compliance with the Berry Amendment and the Buy American Act and officials at both contracting offices conducted training on both domestic-sourcing restrictions.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that DLA officials determine whether noncompliant items were delivered and, when appropriate, obtain compliant replacement items; amend standard operating procedures and internal processes to improve compliance with the Berry Amendment and Buy American Act; issue special notices to inform the public on the lack of domestically-produced items; require that contracting and technical personnel receive training that incorporates the Buy American Act and Small Business Program requirements when soliciting and awarding an acquisition as a small business set-aside; and review the potential Antideficiency Act violations.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Director, Defense Logistics Agency Acquisition, responding for the Commander, Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support; Commander, Defense Logistics Agency Aviation; and the Commander, Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime, generally agreed with our findings and recommendations. The Director agreed to modify contracts we identified as deficient to include the required Berry Amendment and Buy American Act implementing clauses and to determine whether non-compliant items were delivered under the contracts, and where appropriate, obtain replacement items. The Director also agreed to provide training to contracting personnel on procurements subject to the Berry Amendment and the Buy American Act. Therefore, the recommendations are resolved but will remain open until DLA provides documentation to verify that the contracts have been modified, the product reviews are completed, and that the training satisfies the recommendation specifics.\n",
      "The Director, Defense Logistics Agency Acquisition, commenting for the Director, Defense Logistics Agency Finance, partially agreed with the recommendation to initiate a preliminary review in accordance with the DoD 7000.14-R, “DoD Financial Management Regulation,” volume 14, chapter 3, to determine whether reportable violations of the Antideficiency Act occurred on contracts SPE1C1-15-M-2729 and SPMYM2-15-C-0007 on which DLA contracting personnel procured nondomestically produced footwear that did not comply with the Berry Amendment. The Director stated that a preliminary review was initiated on March 3, 2017, for contract SPMYM2-15-C-0007 and will be completed by June 30, 2017. However, the Director disagreed that a preliminary review was required for contract SPE1C1-15-M-2729 because the Director of Defense Logistics Agency, approved a domestic nonavailability determination for footwear on January 18, 2017, that retroactively applied to contract SPE1C1-15-M-2729.\n",
      "We disagree that the Director, Defense Logistics Agency’s approval of a domestic nonavailability determination more than a year after contracting personnel procured the noncompliant footwear, and more than a year after the footwear was delivered and the contract closed, eliminated the preliminary review for a potential Antideficiency Act violation. Therefore, the recommendation is unresolved and remains open.\n",
      "We request that the Director, Defense Logistics Agency Finance, initiate a preliminary review in accordance with DoD 7000.14-R, “DoD Financial Management Regulation,” volume 14, chapter 3, to determine whether reportable violations of the Antideficiency Act occurred on contract SPE1C1-15-M-2729. Additionally, we request that the Director, Defense Logistics Agency Finance, provide DoD policy on “retroactive” nonavailability determinations.

      "We evaluated the effectiveness and oversight of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy 2016 aviation fuel (JA1) contract, valued at $754.8 million.1 Specifically, we evaluated the effectiveness of the Al Udeid Air Base (AUAB) fuel requirements process and oversight of the JA1 fuel contract payment process.\n",
      "Findings\n",
      "Air Force and DLA Energy officials effectively managed the AUAB fuel requirements process. Specifically, Air Force and DLA Energy officials followed the DoD and Air Force guidance to properly develop fuel requirements and contracted for up to 390.6 million gallons of fuel for January through December 2016. In addition, Air Force fuel service center officials properly collected and stored daily AUAB fuel consumption data in the Fuels Manager Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bulk Petroleum Contingency and Capabilities Report systems. As a result, fuel delivered from January through December 2016 was sufficient to sustain AUAB mission operations. In addition, Air Force and DLA Energy officials maintained realistic fuel consumption data to continue developing future fuel requirements for AUAB.\n",
      "However, DLA Energy officials did not provide effective oversight of the contract payment process. Specifically, for 6 of the 22 contractor invoices submitted from January through December 2016:\n",

      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Director, DLA Acquisition, responding for the Director, DLA, agreed with the recommendation to ensure the QARs verify the JA1 fuel delivery quantities before invoices are submitted for payment. The Director, DLA Acquisition, stated that the QARs will receive training on all elements that must be inspected and accepted by QARs in the Invoice, Receipt, Acceptance, and Property Transfer web‑based application, which the contractors use to create and submit electronic invoices and DD Forms 250.

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether Defense organizations made determinations of fair and reasonable pricing for General Services Administration (GSA) Federal supply schedule orders awarded for purchases of supplies. Supplies purchased from the GSA Federal supply schedule are considered commercial items. The Federal supply schedule program allows the Government to purchase commercial supplies and services—such as software licenses, batteries, and digital maps—at prices associated with volume buying. We reviewed a nonstatistical sample of 57 orders, valued at $48 million, at Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), DoD Human Resources Activity (DoDHRA), Defense Health Agency (DHA), and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). This is the third and last in a series of audits on GSA Federal supply schedule orders.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "The Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP), issued policy memorandum, “Class Deviation—Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices When Using Federal Supply Schedule Contracts,” (class deviation) on March 13, 2014. The class deviation requires DoD contracting personnel to make determinations of fair and reasonable pricing for GSA Federal supply schedule orders for supplies and fixed-price services. A deviation is the issuance or use of a policy, procedure, solicitation provision, contract clause, method, or practice of conducting acquisition actions of any kind at any stage of the acquisition process that is inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. A class deviation is a change from guidance that affects more than one contract action.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "WHS, DoDHRA, and DTRA contracting officers made adequate price reasonableness determinations for 10 orders, valued at $7.7 million. Specifically, WHS, DoDHRA, and DTRA contracting officers compared the only quote to adequately prepared independent Government estimates (IGEs), compared the only quote to historical prices that were specifically identified, or compared prices offered under two quotes. In addition, WHS, DoDHRA, and DTRA contracting officers signed and dated price reasonableness determinations for the 10 orders.\n",
      "However, WHS, DoDHRA, DHA, and DTRA contracting officers did not adequately document and support whether the prices paid for 47 orders, valued at $40.3 million, were fair and reasonable. Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "For 40 orders, WHS, DoDHRA, DHA and DTRA contracting officers did not adequately document fair and reasonable pricing. Specifically, the contracting officers did not make price reasonableness determinations, did not sign price reasonableness determinations they made, did not approve in writing price reasonableness determinations made by contract specialists, or made price reasonableness determinations after the award. A DoDHRA contracting officer stated that the contracting officer’s signature on the order certified that the price was fair and reasonable. WHS, DHA, and DTRA contracting officers stated that not signing and dating the price reasonableness determinations was an oversight.\n",
      "For 11 orders, WHS, DoDHRA, and DTRA contracting officers relied on inadequate IGEs that did not identify the source of the information because they relied on the knowledge of the preparers of the IGEs rather than asking the preparers to document and support the estimate and because they were under tight timeframes to award the orders.\n",
      "For 10 orders, WHS, DoDHRA, DHA, and DTRA contracting officers relied on the price lists of the same vendor that submitted the only quote. Contracting officers stated that they were too busy to perform additional price analysis, that the orders were sole-source awards, that they performed other price analysis but did not document the other price analysis in the contract file, or that they performed other price analysis but could not locate the documentation.\n",
      "For one order involving one quote, a DoDHRA contracting officer relied on a discount that the vendor provided as the only price analysis technique. The contracting officer had left the DoDHRA; therefore, we were unable to determine why the contracting officer relied only on the discount.\n",
      "For one order involving two quotes, a WHS contracting officer used a quote eliminated from consideration for technical reasons to make the price reasonableness determination without verifying whether the price was still valid for comparison purposes. The contracting officer had left the WHS; therefore, we were unable to determine why that occurred.\n",
      "For two orders involving one quote, the WHS contracting officers stated that they performed price analysis, but did not document the price analysis in the contract file.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Director, DPAP, and WHS, DoDHRA, DHA, and DTRA management have not issued guidance or provided training to contracting officers related to price reasonableness determinations and price analysis for orders for supplies awarded after Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy issued the class deviation.\n",
      "During the audit, we briefed the Deputy Director for Contract Policy and International Contracting, DPAP, on our findings and proposed recommendations. The Deputy Director stated that DPAP is developing a guidebook for purchasing commercial items. The guidebook will address price reasonableness determinations and price analysis for commercial items, including supplies purchased from the GSA Federal supply schedule, which are considered to be commercial items. In addition, the Deputy Director explained that DPAP officials are coordinating with the Defense Acquisition University to develop training on the requirements in the guidebook. During this meeting, we suggested that DPAP and the Defense Acquisition University should develop the training instead of each Defense organization developing its own training to ensure consistent training across the DoD. The DPAP official agreed and stated that the recommendations should be directed to DPAP instead of the Defense organizations visited during the audit.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Director, DPAP, develop and implement guidance for performing and documenting price analysis and making price reasonableness determinations for GSA Federal supply schedule orders for supplies and develop training for contracting personnel on the guidance.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether Department of the Navy (DON) budget officials adequately supported and justified the civilian full-time equivalents (FTEs) and pay requirements in the Navy and Marine Corps FY 2017 Budget Estimate Submissions. Budget estimates relating to personnel requirements are determined in terms of FTE employment. FTEs are the total number of regular straight-time hours worked, or to be worked, divided by the total number of hours that agencies can pay employees in a fiscal year, which are called compensable hours.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "This is the third in a series of audits in response to the explanatory statement accompanying Public Law 114-113, “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016,” December 18, 2015. The statement directs the DoD Office of Inspector General to report on the Military Services’ civilian compensation program and civilian FTE levels. Specifically, the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Defense and House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Defense expressed concern that the Military Services consistently overestimate the number of civilians that will be employed during a fiscal year, while underestimating the civilian personnel funding requirements.\n",
      "The DON has a decentralized budget process that involves 19 Budget Submitting Offices (BSOs), one of which is the Marine Corps. The DON requested civilian pay in its FY 2017 Budget Estimate Submission for its Operation and Maintenance appropriations. We focused our audit on direct‑funded FTEs in the Operation and Maintenance, Navy (OMN) and Operation and Maintenance, Marine Corps (OMMC) appropriations.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "Although Navy budget officials could justify and explain the process used to develop the FY 2017 civilian pay budget, officials could not fully support how they developed the civilian pay requirements in the FY 2017 OMN Budget Estimate Submission. Navy BSOs used FTEs from the FY 2016 President’s Budget as the starting point to develop their FY 2017 civilian pay budgets. Navy BSOs prepared initial budget estimates based on historical execution data, and they made adjustments to reflect expected future outcomes, such as approved program changes and anticipated pay raises. BSOs submitted issue papers in the Program Budget Information System to document these adjustments to their budgets. Budget officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Budget (FMB) reviewed the BSO budget submissions and made additional pricing and FTE adjustments using issue papers. However, budget officials did not maintain sufficient documentation to support how they developed the FY 2017 civilian pay budget. Specifically, BSO and FMB budget officials did not ensure that issue papers included information about the source data, calculations, and assumptions used for the budget adjustments.\n",
      "When compared to FY 2017 execution, the Navy’s budget request represented the funding needed to pay its civilian personnel. However, maintaining more detailed documentation of budget calculations and assumptions would provide for retention of institutional knowledge and benefit budget officials building future budgets. Understanding the rationale and assumptions used in developing the budget each fiscal year would allow officials to compare budget realities with events that transpired during execution and allow decision makers to better understand budget changes across fiscal years. \n",
      "The Marine Corps could not justify or support how it determined the civilian pay requirements in its FY 2017 OMMC Budget Estimate Submission. Specifically, Marine Corps budget officials could not fully explain the rationale for their civilian pay budget adjustments and did not maintain documentation to support these adjustments.\n",
      "In addition, the Marine Corps budget officials did not determine civilian pay funding levels using FTEs calculated from projected hours to be worked, as required by Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-11. This occurred because Marine Corps budget officials calculated FTEs by dividing total dollars by a historic average cost per FTE. As a result, the Marine Corps under-budgeted its FTEs even though the requested amount represented what was spent to pay civilian personnel for FY 2017. By not accurately budgeting FTEs that aligned with projected hours to be worked, the Marine Corps inaccurately represented its budgeted average cost of an FTE. The average cost per FTE is a ratio that provides context for comparing civilian pay across fiscal years.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller) establish and implement controls for the civilian pay budget process to ensure that budget officials document the calculations and assumptions used to support each Program Budget Information System adjustment made to civilian pay requirements. We also recommend that the Deputy Commandant of the Marine Corps, Programs and Resources, determine budgeted civilian pay funding levels using FTEs calculated based on projected hours to be worked, as required by Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-11.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Director, Civilian Personnel and Business Operations Division, responding for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller), agreed with the recommendation to establish and implement controls for the civilian pay budget process. The Director stated that the Department of the Navy has reviewed its FY 2020 President’s Budget guidance to clearly articulate the need for substantiating data and source information. Additionally, the Department of the Navy is reviewing its civilian pay budget adjustments to ensure a transparent and fully verifiable budget from creation to completion. \n",
      "The comments addressed the recommendation; therefore, the recommendation is resolved but will remain open.

Specifically, we verified if DON headquarters personnel performed QRP assessments. We also verified whether the DON headquarters personnel ensured that the QRP managers followed guidance requiring them to segregate duties, deposit checks timely, ensure checks are made payable to the Department of the Treasury, reject cash payments, develop business plans, reconcile transactions to the accounting system and maintain supporting documentation.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "A QRP is a program that collects and sells eligible scrap materials, such as paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, scrap metal, and brass. Sales proceeds are used to cover the costs directly attributable to operating expenses of the program. After the costs are recovered, up to 50 percent of the remaining proceeds can be used for pollution reduction and similar projects at the installation or region, and any remaining proceeds can be transferred to the nonappropriated morale, welfare, and recreation account. If the balance available at the end of any fiscal year is more than $2 million, the amount of that excess is deposited into the Department of the Treasury account as miscellaneous receipts.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "The DON did not provide adequate oversight at the 10 QRPs reviewed. Specifically, DON headquarters personnel did not adequately perform assessments, which include a review of QRP financial records, and oversight to verify that the QRP managers were following guidance for operating a QRP. \n",
      "Because guidance was not followed, the QRP managers did not:\n",
      "\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) and subordinate commands developed, reviewed, and validated requirements for the Philippines Operations Support Contract (POSC) III to ensure the adequate provision of services.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "On February 23, 2017, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific awarded the POSC III. This contract is a cost-plus-incentive-fee contract with a maximum dollar value of $58 million, including the base year and four option periods with a 6‑month extension, to provide base operating support services. \n",
      "In September 2017, the Secretary of Defense designated Operation Pacific Eagle‑Philippines as a contingency operation. USPACOM, in coordination with other DoD elements, government agencies, and partner nations, executes this contingency operation as a counterterrorism campaign supporting the Republic of the Philippines. \n",
      "In order to execute the POSC III, constant communication and collaboration are required among Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific and USPACOM and its subordinate commands, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific and U.S. Special Operations Command Pacific (SOCPAC). \n",
      "To validate contract requirements, the POSC III and other service contracts are subject to a Services Requirements Review Board (SRRB). An SRRB is a formal process to identify, plan, prioritize, and validate contract service requirements before issuing funding documents. The SRRB increases stakeholder awareness of service requirements, provides for the prioritization of requirements to support funding decisions, and increases collaboration on key strategy decisions to optimize services acquisitions and enable efficiencies.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "USPACOM, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Pacific, and SOCPAC developed, reviewed, and validated requirements without an SRRB because at the time the POSC III contract was awarded, guidance did not require an SRRB for base operating support contracts to ensure the adequate provision of services. After contract award, Navy guidance for conducting SRRBs changed, and base operating support contracts were no longer exempt from going through an SRRB to validate contract requirements for both original contracts and each option period exercised. However, USPACOM and SOCPAC did not formally re-validate the POSC III requirements through an SRRB before authorizing about $8.2 million in March 2018 to exercise the first option period starting on April 1, 2018, in accordance with Navy, USPACOM, and SOCPAC SRRB guidance. \n",
      "This occurred because USPACOM and SOCPAC officials were unaware of the March 1, 2018, deadline agreed upon between the Project Manager and Naval Facilities Engineering Command Pacific to authorize funding to execute the option period to avoid any lapse in service and did not plan to hold an SRRB in time. Due to the uncertain nature of contingency operations and members of the Special Operations Task Force in the Philippines rotating every 6 months, there is an increased risk that the contract requirements may not meet mission needs. Because USPACOM and SOCPAC did not re‑validate the POSC III requirements through an SRRB before exercising the first option period, USPACOM and SOCPAC cannot ensure efficient use of command resources and compliance with applicable regulations, policy, and guidance. The POSC III has three additional option periods, with a total value of about $49 million. Therefore, validating contract requirements through an SRRB process is necessary to ensure USPACOM and SOCPAC do not duplicate requirements or pay for unneeded services in the future.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the USPACOM Commander direct all subordinate commands to ensure SRRB processes are consistent and compliant with higher-level directives. In addition, in instances where USPACOM delegates SRRB responsibility to subordinate commands, it should require supporting documentation from the commands verifying compliance with SRRB guidance. \n",
      "Additionally, we recommend that the USPACOM Commander, in coordination with the SOCPAC Commander, hold an SRRB before authorizing additional funding for the remainder of the POSC III first option period and provide training on command SRRB guidance to all current and future personnel working on services contracts.\n",
      "Management Actions Taken:\n",
      "During the audit, we notified officials from USPACOM and SOCPAC of our concerns of not re-validating the POSC III requirements through an SRRB before authorizing funding in March 2018 to exercise the first option period. USPACOM and SOCPAC officials agreed with our recommendations and immediately initiated corrective actions. Specifically, the USPACOM J8 Comptroller Office sent an e-mail directing all subordinate Comptrollers to submit evidence that their organization has an SRRB policy in effect and an SRRB was conducted before USPACOM will release funding for any contracted services over $150,000. The USPACOM J8 Comptroller Office also distributed the USPACOM SRRB guidance for reference. In addition, SOCPAC held an SRRB on April 10, 2018, to re-validate the POSC III contract requirements for the remainder of the first option period. \n",
      "Furthermore, the USPACOM J8 Comptroller stated that USPACOM will develop and conduct training for its SRRB process to ensure all personnel are aware of current and updated SRRB guidance. The training will be conducted at USPACOM’s May 2018 SRRB. In addition, SOCPAC officials will conduct the training at a town hall in June 2018. \n",
      "The management actions taken by USPACOM and SOCPAC addressed the concerns we identified; therefore, we consider the recommendations related to issuing guidance and performing an SRRB closed and the recommendation related to training resolved pending receipt of additional documentation showing that the SRRB training was conducted.\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition, the U.S. Army Materiel Command did not design the Logistics Modernization Program system with the functionality to identify receiving and invoice documents stored in another system. Finally, ASA(FM&C) personnel could not identify the amounts it previously credited to customers for inventory items returned for credit or repair.\n",
      "As a result, the Army is not ready for an AWCF financial statement audit and will likely not be audit ready by the mandatory deadline on September 30, 2017. The Army’s inability to provide supporting documentation for AWCF inventory transactions is one reason it receives an annual disclaimer of opinion. Consequently, the Army is unable to support the $10.6 billion value of its Inventory, Available and Purchased for Resale, reported on the AWCF balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, as reflected in the Army’s disclaimer of opinion.2\n",
      "Recommendations\n",

      "We determined whether the DoD complied with Public Law 113-101, “The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014” (DATA Act). Specifically, we assessed the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of the DoD second quarter FY 2017 financial and award data submitted for publication on USASpending.gov and the DoD’s implementation and use of the Government-wide financial data standards (data elements) established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). \n",
      "Background \n",
      " \n",
      "The DATA Act was enacted to expand on previous Federal transparency legislation. The purpose of the DATA Act is to disclose and link Federal funds to increase accountability and transparency of Government spending to the public. Specifically, the DATA Act improves the quality of data submitted to USASpending.gov by holding Federal agencies accountable for the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted. The DATA Act required the OMB and the Treasury to establish Government-wide financial data elements over Federal funds by May 2015. Therefore, in May 2015, the OMB and the Treasury issued standardized data elements with definitions and required Federal agencies to report financial and award data in accordance with these elements for publication on USASpending.gov by May 2017. The OMB also issued memorandum No. 2016-03 requiring agencies to designate a Senior Accountable Official (SAO), who, on a quarterly basis, must provide reasonable assurance that the agency’s internal controls support reliability and validity of the financial and award data submitted to the Treasury for publication on USASpending.gov. \n",

Specifically, for the second quarter of FY 2017, the DoD SAO did not certify and submit complete award data, timely award data, accurate financial and award data, and quality financial and award data for publication on USASpending.gov. These conditions occurred because the:\n",

      "In addition, the DoD SAO implemented and used Government-wide data elements applicable to the financial data established by the OMB and the Treasury. However, the DoD did not implement and use the Government-wide data elements applicable to award data established by the OMB and the Treasury. Specifically, the DoD did not submit the required data elements for procurement and grant awards and did not comply with the OMB and the Treasury Governmentwide data element definitions. \n",

Mission-critical IT systems are necessary to continue warfighter operations and direct mission support of warfighter operations, while mission-essential IT systems are basic and necessary to accomplish an organization’s mission. DITPR contains information required for analyzing DoD inventory, portfolios, and capabilities. As of April 2016, DITPR contained system information for 6,169 individual IT systems across 47 DoD Components.\n",

      "The DoD cannot rely on DITPR data and has spent at least $30.8 million since 2004 to operate, maintain, and update a system that contains incomplete and inaccurate IT system data. Unless data quality is improved, the DoD cannot effectively plan for the continued operations of mission-critical and mission-essential IT systems, use DITPR for decision making as intended, or support statutory compliance reporting. For example, inaccurate and incomplete interfacing system information limits DoD’s ability to plan for IT system disruptions. Because disruptions in one IT system can result in disruptions in interfacing systems, it is critical for contingency planning that interface data is accurate and complete. Unexpected disruption in the use of a mission-critical or mission-essential IT system could negatively impact warfighter operations or direct mission support for warfighter operations.\n",

      "Cybersecurity is critical to DoD operations; however, cybersecurity remains a significant challenge for the DoD. Executive Order 13800 mandates that agencies use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to manage cybersecurity risk. The five functions in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Core also provide a strategic view of cybersecurity risk management. \n",
      "In summarizing 29 unclassified reports and 1 unclassified testimony issued by the DoD oversight community and GAO between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017, we determined that the DoD still faces challenges in key cybersecurity risk areas pertaining to Identify, Protect, and Detect functions. These three functions are designed to help an organization to understand its cybersecurity risks, implement appropriate safeguards, and identify cybersecurity events. Specifically, the reports we reviewed identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "weaknesses in establishing or maintaining inventories for information systems, hardware, and software licenses; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "weaknesses in system account and password management as well as in physical access to information technology assets;\n",

      "weaknesses in vulnerability and configuration management as well as incident response testing and continuity planning and testing; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "weaknesses in the Security Continuous Monitoring and Detection Processes categories of the Detect function. Security continuous monitoring of information systems is used to identify cybersecurity events while detection processes are used to ensure timely and adequate awareness of anomalous events. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to summarizing the reports and aligning them within the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, we also reviewed the reports to identify findings relevant to the IG FISMA Reporting Metrics. FISMA requires each federal agency to develop, document, and implement an Agency-Wide information security program to protect the information and information systems supporting agency operations and assets. FISMA also requires federal IGs to conduct an annual independent evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the agency’s information security program and practices and report the results to the Office of Management and Budget. We used the summarized findings and recommendations when developing this report to support the DoD IG annual independent evaluation and reporting requirement, which we communicated to the DoD Chief Information Officer on October 31, 2017. \n",
      "Of the 29 unclassified reports and 1 unclassified testimony we reviewed, we identified 26 reports that identified DoD weaknesses associated with the seven FY 2017 IG F ISMA Reporting Metrics. The metrics with the most frequent weaknesses identified in the reports were the Risk Management, Identity and Access Management, and Configuration Management metrics. The 26 reports are a subset of the 29 reports that pertained to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions, and the most pervasive DoD cybersecurity weaknesses are discussed in the first paragraph of this Summary.\n",
      "To help ensure that the DoD provides adequate oversight of the DoD risks pertaining to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the IG FISMA Reporting Metrics, we plan to discuss the results of this DoD cybersecurity summary project at future meetings of the Defense Council on Integrity and Efficiency (DCIE) Information Technology Committee and use these results in planning reviews of cybersecurity by DoD oversight organizations. Finally, we also intend to include classified reports in future cybersecurity summary reviews to provide a fuller summary of oversight of DoD cybersecurity activities.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the DoD adequately monitored contractor performance and conducted sufficient invoice reviews for services provided under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) IV contract in Afghanistan.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "LOGCAP is an Army program, established in 1992, which uses contractors to provide logistical and sustainment services to deployed forces, such as dining and laundry facilities, housing, construction, transportation, facilities maintenance, and fire and emergency services. \n",
      "On July 7, 2009, the Army Contracting Command–Rock Island awarded two cost‑reimbursable task orders for LOGCAP services in Afghanistan. Cost‑reimbursable contracts provide payment of allowable incurred costs and require contractors to submit interim vouchers to obtain payments for costs they incurred to perform the contract.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "We determined that DoD officials did not conduct sufficient voucher reviews for services provided under the LOGCAP IV contract. Specifically, Army Contracting Command and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) officials did not adequately monitor all 128 LOGCAP IV vouchers submitted from 2015 to 2017 for questionable and potentially unallowable costs.\n",
      "This inadequate monitoring occurred because DoD policy regarding voucher reviews did not clearly state what role contracting officials should have in reviewing vouchers or establish an expectation of how the contract administration office could augment DCAA voucher reviews. In addition, DoD policy established DCAA prepayment reviews as the sole method of voucher oversight prior to payment; however, prepayment reviews are cursory reviews not sufficient for preventing reimbursement to the contractor for all potentially unallowable costs. \n",
      "As a result, the Army paid all 128 LOGCAP vouchers the LOGCAP contractors submitted from 2015 to 2017, valued at $2.4 billion, with little or no examination of the supporting documentation. We identified at least $536 million of the $2.4 billion billed on vouchers that were supported by questionable documentation that warranted further analysis. Specifically, the contractor provided supporting documentation for labor, employee travel, and employee bonuses that did not contain sufficient detail for us to determine how the contractor calculated costs. In addition, we identified a $32 million voucher the contractor submitted for labor and expenses, which did not include accounting transactions that supported the costs billed. Furthermore, we identified at least $26 million in direct labor for employees who were not physically present in Afghanistan. We also identified $422,825 in costs that, based on the description of the costs in contractor’s accounting data, may not be allowable. \n",
      "In addition, the Army Contracting Command–Afghanistan (ACC-A) did not monitor all contract requirements. For example, CORs did not determine whether contractors were fulfilling contract requirements to meet DoD Fire and Emergency Services Program standards or food service sanitation standards. \n",
      "This inadequate monitoring occurred because ACC-A officials used a program-wide LOGCAP Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP), which contained generic surveillance checklists not designed to monitor specific LOGCAP services used by the Army in Afghanistan.\n",
      "As a result, ACC-A officials did not have reasonable assurance that the contractor performed all 28 active LOGCAP IV services in Afghanistan in accordance with contract requirements. Using generic surveillance checklists resulted in CORs conducting quality assurance inspections that did not identify deficiencies in contractor performance because they did not identify specific requirements for high-risk services, such as procedures for verifying response times for fire and emergency services and food preparation and storage requirements for dining facilities. This increased health and safety risks to U.S. and Coalition personnel.\n",

This action addresses our recommendation and the recommendation will be closed when we verify the planned actions are fully implemented.\n",
      "On January 8, 2018, we met with senior DCAA policy officials to discuss the costs we identified as supported by questionable documentation. The DCAA officials were responsive to our concerns and took immediate action. Specifically, to address our concern over clustered costs, the DCAA obtained from the contractor more detailed cost data from its accounting system, which matched the total amount and total hours that were billed on four clustered transactions we provided to DCAA as examples of clustered transactions. In addition, DCAA began to investigate the $422,825 we found to be potentially unallowable and stated that it has not found any significant unallowable costs. This action addresses our recommendation and will be closed when we verify the planned actions are fully implemented.\n",
      "During the audit, we also advised the ACC-A PARC that deficiencies existed in contractor performance oversight. The PARC agreed with our observations and took immediate action to resolve our concerns. Specifically, ACC-A officials created a new QASP specific to LOGCAP IV, task orders 0 004 and 0 005.

      " \n",
      "Our objective was to determine whether the DoD’s purchase card and travel card reporting on fraud, waste, abuse, and misuse was complete and accurate. Specifically, we reviewed the DoD’s FYs 2015 and 2016 quarterly statistical travel card reports, quarterly statistical purchase card reports, and semiannual violation purchase card reports that the DoD submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Additionally, Title 10 United States Code § 2784 requires the DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) to conduct periodic audits and review of the purchase card program. \n",
      " \n",
      "During the audit, OMB guidance changed on June 15, 2017, to no longer require that agencies submit quarterly reports on travel and purchase card misuse or delinquencies. OMB still required the department to continue to maintain statistical, narrative, and violation information for DoD use. Even though reporting to OMB is no longer required, collecting and maintaining accurate information on misuse and delinquencies is valuable data for DoD decision makers to use to effectively manage the travel and purchase card programs. \n",

      "During the audit the previous Director, DPAP, was nominated to a new post. The current Director performs two roles and is now Director, Defense Pricing (DP)/Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP).

      " \n",
      "Background:\n",
      " \n",
      "OMB reporting requirements use the word misuse as a broad term that includes various categories of improper transactions such as fraud, waste, abuse, personal use, other loss, and misappropriation of funds or assets. As a result, we use the word misuse throughout this report as a general term when referring to improper charge card transactions. \n",
      " \n",
      "This audit is the third report the DoD OIG has produced regarding travel card misuse. The first report focused on identification of improper travel card use and the second focused on the DoD’s response to the improper use identified in the first report. This audit focuses on purchase card and travel card reports that the DoD was required to submit to OMB. \n",
      " \n",
      "Findings:\n",
      " \n",
      "We determined that the DoD provided incomplete and inaccurate charge card information to OMB during FYs 2015 and 2016. Specifically, we found that DPAP officials reported inaccurate, incomplete, and unsupported quarterly and semiannual purchase card information to OMB. For example, on the semiannual violations report to OMB, for the second half of FY 2015, the Military Services sent 1,043 misuse transactions to DPAP to be reported; however, DPAP only reported 47 to OMB. In addition, during FYs 2015 and 2016, quarterly statistical reports provided to OMB were incomplete because they did not include over 51,000 delinquencies in purchase card payments, as required by OMB. This occurred because DPAP personnel did not provide sufficient oversight of the purchase card program or its supporting functions. Specifically, DPAP did not:\n",
      "\n",
      "implement the processes or procedures necessary to compile accurate, complete, or supported reports to OMB;\n",
      "provide effective oversight of the subordinate purchase card program managers for the Army, Air Force, and Defense agencies; or \n",
      "evaluate whether the Purchase Card On-line System (PCOLS) was suitable to oversee the purchase card program. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "As a result, DPAP and purchase card officials within the DoD purchase card program, which spent $10 Billion during the two years we reviewed, will be unable to identify patterns of improper transactions, opportunities to improve the program’s efficiencies, or areas where program reviewers should focus their emphasis until DPAP corrects these problems. \n",
      " \n",
      "In addition, we found that Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) officials significantly underreported to OMB the number of administrative or disciplinary actions taken for travel card misuse, including delinquencies. Specifically, for FYs 2015 and 2016, DTMO reported only 139 cases of “administrative and/or disciplinary actions.” However, we determined that DTMO should have reported at least 263,160 actions for the 2-year period. This significant underreporting occurred because the DTMO used only one incomplete source, the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System, to report on travel card misuse, did not implement a tool that tracks misuse, and did not report delinquency data. Because of the underreporting, DTMO officials and Component program managers (CPMs) were unable to establish a reliable baseline of misuse, implement sufficient management controls to prevent misuse, or increase reviewer emphasis on key areas of misuse and delinquencies in the travel card program. \n",
      " \n",
      "Corrective Actions Taken:\n",
      " \n",
      "During this audit, DoD officials took actions to correct and improve their reporting to OMB. Specifically, the previous Director, DPAP, issued guidance on the reporting process and clarified definitions. Based on OMB guidance, DPAP revised its policy to state that the purchase card program will continue to maintain statistical, narrative, and violation information for DoD use, but will no longer submit the information to OMB.\n",
      " \n",
      "In addition, DTMO officials took actions to correct and improve their reporting to OMB. Specifically, starting with second quarter FY 2017 reporting, DTMO included delinquencies and misuse identified using Visa IntelliLink; it also updated guidance to require reporting of all misuse to DTMO.

Therefore, this recommendation remains unresolved. The recommendation was designed to provide assurance that transaction reviewers made accurate conclusions on the validity of the transactions flagged in PCOLS and the transaction compliance with applicable criteria. However, the DPAP response focuses on the effectiveness of the data mining system’s business rules in producing the desired result, rather than on the accuracy of conclusions made by lower level reviewers on flagged transactions. Therefore, we request that the Director, DP/DPAP, provide the detailed corrective actions that will be taken to conduct statistically valid samples of reviewed transactions to determine whether accurate conclusions were made on the validity of the transaction and its compliance with applicable criteria.  \n",

We will close the recommendation upon receipt of the updated regulations, memorandum, and verification of the implementation of the IntelliLink analytics Module.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Director, DTMO, stated that a tool was available to track delinquent accounts and acknowledged that not reporting on those delinquencies was a result of misinterpreting the reporting requirements, As a result we have clarified in the final report that DTMO did not develop or implement a tool that tracks misuse, and that delinquencies were not reported to clarify the condition. \n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Department of the Navy (Navy) achieved the performance capabilities for the Expeditionary Fast Transport (EPF) program.  \n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The EPF vessel, formerly named the Joint High Speed Vessel, is an aluminum catamaran capable of transferring personnel and cargo.  The EPF vessel will be used to transport personnel, supplies, and equipment in support of a wide range of military and civilian contingencies, evacuations, and disaster relief.  \n",
      "The Program Executive Office Ships (PEO Ships) manages the design and construction of destroyers, amphibious ships, special mission and support ships, and all Navy non-nuclear surface ships.  The Strategic and Theater Sealift Program Office (Program Office) reports to PEO Ships and manages the $2 billion EPF program through vessel delivery.  Since 2008, the Navy has purchased 12 EPF vessels from Austal USA.  Austal USA is a global defense prime contractor that designs and manufactures commercial and defense ships.\n",
      "As of August 2017, the Navy accepted delivery of eight EPF vessels.  Upon acceptance, the Navy transferred the EPF vessels to the Military Sealift Command (MSC).  The MSC is responsible for the operation and sustainment of the EPF vessel, including any changes made to the EPF vessel after it is accepted.  Austal USA is currently constructing four EPF vessels and expects to deliver the final EPF vessel in FY 2019. \n",
      "Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) is the independent test agency that tests and evaluates the Navy’s warfighting capabilities under realistic operational conditions to determine the systems’ effectiveness, suitability, and impact on mission accomplishment.  \n",
      "COMOPTEVFOR completed the initial operational test and evaluation of the EPF program in January 2014.  The initial operational test and evaluation is conducted to determine whether systems are operationally effective and suitable.  In April 2015, COMOPTEVFOR completed the follow-on operational test and evaluation.  The follow-on operational test and evaluation reviews system changes and verifies that the program continues to meet operational needs and retains its effectiveness in new environments or against new threats.  During these tests, COMOPTEVFOR identified deficiencies.  As part of the verification of deficiencies process, COMOPTEVFOR confirms that deficiencies were corrected.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "Program Office officials did not achieve the performance capabilities for the EPF program.  Specifically, Program Office officials obligated $2 billion for the EPF program; however, the EPF vessel had deficiencies that prevented it from attaining its required performance capabilities, including two key performance parameters—Transport Capability and Net Ready.   This occurred because Program Office officials did not demonstrate that they corrected deficiencies identified during low-rate initial production (initial production).  Initial production is when a minimum quantity is produced for testing.  \n",
      "As a result, Navy officials accepted eight EPF vessels with deficiencies that could prevent the MSC from accomplishing missions.  The Navy may also have to spend additional money to achieve the required performance capabilities for EPF vessels that were already provided to the fleet and for future EPF vessels that are still in production.  \n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Program Executive Officer, PEO Ships, with assistance from the Program Office, review whether action was taken to correct deficiencies on EPF vessels.  If action was taken, PEO Ships should require the Program Office to request COMOPTEVFOR to confirm the correction of deficiencies.  If action was not taken, PEO Ships should require the Program Office to implement a plan to correct the deficiencies prior to delivery of the EPF vessels, as appropriate. \n",
      "Additionally, we recommend that the Commander, MSC, identify whether deficiencies on delivered EPF vessels were corrected.  If the deficiencies were not corrected, the Commander, MSC, should implement a plan to correct the deficiencies, as appropriate.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) (ASN [RD&A]), responding for the Program Executive Officer, PEO Ships, and the Commander, MSC, addressed the specifics of the recommendations.\n",
      "The ASN (RD&A) stated that the Navy partially agreed with our recommendations.  The Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) agreed to work with the resource manager and the MSC for concurrence on Transport Capability and unrefueled range limitations deficiencies.  The Commander, NAVSEA also agreed to conduct further assessments on the rigid hull inflatable boat launch and recovery and the aft mission deck layout.  This recommendation is resolved but will remain open.  We will close this recommendation when the Program Office demonstrates that the resource sponsor and the MSC accepted the Transport Capability and unrefueled range limitations, and when the Program Office conducts further assessments to resolve the rigid hull inflatable boat launch and recovery and the aft mission deck layout.  \n",
      "The ASN (RD&A) stated that the Navy agreed with our recommendation.  The Commander, MSC, stated that the MSC will continue to work with PEO Ships and the Program Office to review and implement appropriate corrections in the delivered fleet.  This recommendation is resolved but will remain open.  We will close this recommendation when the MSC provides documentation to show reviews were conducted and appropriate corrections were implemented in the delivered fleet.  \n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) implemented corrective actions for the recommendations in Report No. DODIG-2017-015, “Application Level General Controls for the Defense Cash Accountability System Need Improvement,” November 10, 2016, and determined whether those actions corrected the reported problems.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "Report No. DODIG-2017-015 identified that the Defense Cash Accountability System (DCAS) application level general controls that DFAS administered in FY 2016 did not operate effectively. Specifically, we made 20 recommendations to mitigate vulnerabilities in security management, access, configuration management, and contingency planning controls.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "Business Enterprise Information Services (BEIS) Office personnel implemented corrective actions that improved the design and operating effectiveness of several key application level general controls including security management, access controls, configuration management, and contingency planning. This occurred because BEIS Office personnel developed, revised, disseminated, and implemented policies and procedures and trained personnel on the specific requirements for application level general controls. As a result, selected controls were operating effectively to minimize risks associated with the intent of the controls, and 11 of 20 prior recommendations are closed.\n",
      "Additionally, BEIS Office personnel made control design improvements in access and configuration management controls, meeting the intent of four additional recommendations, which are closed. However, BEIS Office personnel have not yet verified that four controls related to access and configuration management controls are operating as intended. BEIS Office personnel need to take additional actions to demonstrate the successful implementation of these controls. Without confirmation that these access and configuration management controls were operating as intended, DCAS remains vulnerable to inappropriate user access and critical system discrepancies. \n",
      "Although these control enhancements closed 15 recommendations, BEIS Office personnel need to make additional improvements to security management, configuration management, and contingency planning controls. Also, we redirected one prior recommendation related to table change documentation from BEIS Office personnel to DFAS Enterprise Shared Services (ESS) personnel because DCAS policy requires DFAS ESS personnel to verify and track that Master Data Table changes are authorized, configured, and operating effectively. Therefore, 5 of 20 prior recommendations remain open. Without proper controls, DCAS is vulnerable to availability interruptions and lost or incorrectly processed data. Consequently, the DoD could experience financial losses from expensive efforts to recover financial data, and DoD leadership’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete financial data processed to make critical decisions. \n",
      "Finally, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Customer Service Representative did not perform the 2017 annual review of the DCAS Service Level Agreement to ensure agreements by all DCAS parties are still applicable for the next 12 months. This occurred because the Revenue Branch Chief did not instruct the DISA Customer Account Representative of the annual review requirement. As a result, necessary financial or service level changes may not occur, which could impact the performance of DCAS which DoD uses to process and report its disbursement and collection of funds to the U.S. Treasury and DoD.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "As a result of our followup, we recommend that the DFAS BEIS and Other Systems Director:\n",
      "\n",
      "review and verify policies and procedures to execute periodic user reviews are operating effectively by documenting that 100 percent of sensitive users are reviewed each quarter and 100 percent of authorized users are reviewed within the last year;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "review and verify that privileged user reviews are conducted within consistent timeframes from the end of each quarter;\n",

      "\n",
      "coordinate with DISA to schedule and conduct the annual DCAS Information System Contingency Plan testing within a year of the prior testing. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we redirected one recommendation to the DFAS Operations Deputy Director to verify changes made by the Table Administrators to the DCAS Master Data Tables are authorized, tested, approved, monitored, and tracked. \n",
      "We also recommend that the DISA Defense Working Capital Fund Revenue Branch Chief train DISA Enterprise Services personnel on the requirements of Service Level Agreement guidance, including annual review and documentation requirements. \n",
      "Additionally, we recommend that the DISA Operations Center Financial Resource Management Office Chief develop and implement procedures to ensure annual Service Level Agreement reviews are conducted.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The DFAS Information and Technology Director, responding for the DFAS BEIS and Other Systems Director, agreed with the recommendations to review, refine, implement, and verify policies and procedures to execute periodic user reviews, exception report reviews, and emergency changes consistently. Additionally, the Information and Technology Director agreed with the recommendation to coordinate with DISA to conduct annual DCAS Information System Contingency Plan testing no greater than every 12 months. Therefore, these recommendations are resolved but remain open. We will close the recommendations once we verify that BEIS Office personnel perform and document all user reviews consistently; that the reformatted exception report and revised procedures consistently identify exceptions; that the DCAS System Master Software Development Plan was updated to include emergency changes and the Configuration Control Board criteria; and that the DCAS Information System Contingency Plan was tested annually. \n",
      "The DFAS Information and Technology Director, responding for DFAS BEIS and Other Systems Director, partially agreed with the recommendation to monitor the status of four open recommendations and expedite actions to close them. Specifically, the Information and Technology Director disagreed with the recommendation to require Information System Security Officers to comply with the certification requirements established in DoD Manual 8570.01-M.5 The Information and Technology Director stated that DFAS separated account management functions from privileged system administration functions, and personnel in this role were erroneously included in the DoD Chief Information Office Cybersecurity Strategy Workforce, of which personnel require cybersecurity certification. We disagree that the account managers are not privileged users. Therefore, this recommendation is unresolved and remains open. \n",
      "The DFAS ESS Director, responding for the DFAS BEIS and Other Systems Director, agreed with the recommendation to train Information Owners, their representatives, and Center Administrators to authorize appropriate access levels before approving each user account. Additionally, the DFAS ESS Director agreed with recommendations to verify changes made by the Table Administrators to the DCAS Master Data Tables are authorized, tested, approved, monitored, and tracked. Therefore, these recommendations are resolved but remain open. We will close the recommendations once we obtain documentation and verify that only appropriate access levels are authorized and DCAS Table Administrators make only authorized, tested, approved, monitored, and tracked changes to the DCAS Master Data Table. \n",
      "The DISA Operations Center Financial Management Division Chief, responding for the DISA Defense Working Capital Fund Revenue Branch Chief, agreed with the recommendation to train the Operations Center Financial Management Division personnel for Service Level Agreement review and documentation requirements. Additionally, the Chief agreed with the recommendation to develop and implement procedures to ensure the DISA Customer Account Representative conducts and documents the annual SLA review as required, stating that the Customer Account Representative Desk Guide was revised accordingly. Therefore, these recommendations are resolved but remain open. We will close the recommendations once we verify that the Desk Guide was revised and personnel review and update annual SLAs. \n",

M SC officials established contract requirements to ensure spare parts are purchased at fair and reasonable prices through competition; however, MSC officials could not provide evidence that the contractor always followed the requirements. Specifically, MSC officials could not provide evidence that the contractor adequately competed or provided justification for not competing 3 of the 9 purchases over $25,000 or 5 of the 12 purchases between $3,000 and $25,000, made during FY 2016.1 The contract required at least three quotes for transactions over $3,000 in order to receive reimbursement for supplies. Further, the contracting officer did not modify the contract section that stated the use of the DSS was optional despite revising the section that stated the DSS should be used unless the contractor had a valid reason not to. These problems occurred because the MSC officials did not provide adequate oversight to ensure the contractor complied with the updated competition requirements for the contract and that the contracting officer properly modified the contract to clarify and require the query of the DSS.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We initiated this audit in response to a March 2016 request by the DON Office of Budget within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Financial Management and Comptroller (ASN[FM&C]). Specifically, the DON Office of Budget requested that we review the actions it took to address the recommendations from the 2015 reports and if possible close the recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The TAR is an internal control practice that checks the timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of commitments, obligations, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and unfilled customer orders (financial transactions). The TAR occurs three times per fiscal year, with review periods ending on January 31, May 31, and September 30.  The goal of the TAR is to identify financial obligations that can be canceled or used for another purpose before the associated funds expire.\n",

Specifically, we found that DON Budget Submitting Offices (BSOs) did not support the validity and accuracy of obligations reviewed during the TAR. Because the DON Office of Budget did not issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) and perform quality assurance, the DON’s TAR of obligations (both unliquidated obligations and unfilled orders) did not provide reasonable assurance that balances reported on the financial statements were correct. As of November 1, 2017, 11 recommendations from our prior reports remained open.

Specifically, the DON Office of Budget trained BSO personnel regarding their TAR roles and responsibilities. The DON Office of Budget also developed a TAR SOP; however, it did not implement the SOP and take actions to correct the findings identified in our prior reports.

      "In addition, the DON Office of Budget did not ensure that DON BSOs completed the TAR in accordance with the DoD FMR. Of the 11 BSOs we reviewed, only 3 BSOs complied with the DoD FMR.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This occurred because the DON Office of Budget officials focused on developing standard queries needed to extract data from many complex financial systems before developing and implementing an SOP. The DON has attempted multiple efforts since 2015 to implement tools and capabilities sufficient to remediate the previous recommendations. However, due to the complexities of multiple financial systems, this effort produced minimal results and was put on hold in favor of a manual, labor-intensive effort. The DON Office of Budget officials continue to work with DON system owners to find an automated solution to develop data sets from multiple DON accounting systems and alleviate the manual data call method currently in use.\n",

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA) Superintendent had implemented recommendations in DoD OIG Report No. DODIG-2012-017, “U.S. Naval Academy Officials Did Not Adhere to Contracting and Gift Policies,” November 7, 2011.\n",
      "The USNA Superintendent had agreed to direct the USNA Museum Director to:\n",

      "establish access controls to the inventory system to prevent unauthorized modification or deletion of inventory records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Report No. DODIG-2012-017 identified that in-kind gifts (non-monetary gifts classified as heritage assets that have historical significance) were not properly recorded into the inventory system; a complete inventory of all items maintained by the USNA Museum had never been done; 21,700 of nearly 53,000 heritage assets in the Museum’s inventory system did not have an identification number or a complete identification number; security controls were not established to prevent unauthorized modification or deletion of heritage assets in the inventory system; and the inventory system of the NHHC, which is responsible for preserving, analyzing, and disseminating U.S. Naval history and heritage, was not used.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "The USNA Museum Director implemented recommendations to establish policies and procedures for recording inventory, provide quarterly reports to NHHC, assign identification numbers to items in the inventory system, and establish security access controls to prevent unauthorized modification or deletion of inventory records.\n",
      "In response to the prior audit, the USNA superintendent stated that a baseline inventory of all heritage assets had been completed in 2014. We requested but USNA museum officials could not provide documentation to support that a baseline inventory was conducted in 2014. We then reviewed their current inventory system to determine when these heritage assets were last inventoried. We determined that 30,857 (50 percent) of 61,693 recorded heritage assets were not inventoried following the issuance of the prior audit report. The Museum officials stated that the museum experienced a complete turnover in management staff since the last audit in 2011, and the documentation was not maintained to support that an inventory was conducted. Using the current inventory system, we also determined that 129 artifacts had been physically transferred to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, but a transfer agreement was never finalized.\n",
      "In addition, we identified 270 items that may be duplicates or belong to a group of items that have already been accessioned (accepted by the museum). Furthermore, we identified 45 items that museum officials considered lost; however, museum officials did not complete a DD Form 200 “Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss” to record those lost items when necessary.\n",
      "Additionally, the Director has not implemented the NHHC inventory system as agreed to in the prior report. This occurred because he was waiting for system testing and transfer of inventory records to the new system, both of which were scheduled to be completed by July 2017. Therefore, we determined that this recommendation is resolved but will remain open. We will close the recommendation once we verify that the actions the USNA staff takes fully addresses the recommendation.\n",
      "Without a complete and accurate inventory, the museum heritage assets remain vulnerable to loss and theft. In addition, the inventory reported on the Department of the Navy Balance Sheet, Note 9, “Property, Plant and Equipment,” Section “Heritage Assets and Stewardship Land,” may not be accurate.\n",

      "reconcile the USNA Museum Found-in-Collection and duplicate records with already accessioned inventory items, when possible;\n",
      "complete a DD Form 200 for lost assets as the director deems it necessary, or document the reason if the form was not needed; and\n",
      "prepare and complete a transfer agreement for any artifacts that were physically transferred to the Smithsonian Museum. If the permanent transfer of these artifacts is not completed, then these artifacts should be recorded as loaned items in the USNA Museum inventory.\n",

      "We also recommend that the USNA Inspector General provide progress updates to the USNA Superintendent on completion of the baseline inventory.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The USNA Superintendent addressed all specifics of the recommendations. Specifically, to prioritize the completion of a baseline inventory, the USNA requested support, reassigned staff, suspended most public and midshipmen tours, and reduced academic support for midshipmen research papers. The USNA will reconcile the USNA Museum Found-in-Collection and duplicate records and will develop a plan to determine the disposition of items that cannot be reconciled to existing records. The USNA will complete the DD Form 200 when required and prepare a transfer agreement for the artifacts that were physically transferred to the Smithsonian Museum. Therefore, the recommendations are resolved but will remain open.

Since the 1970s, the Army has developed multiple variants of the Hellfire air-to-ground missile, each with varying capabilities, as an equalizer against enemy tanks.

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) properly validated procurement quantities for Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs).\n",
      "Background\n",
      "We performed this audit because the DoD Office of Inspector General previously reported in three reports that the Army, Navy, and Air Force could not support or justify the need for procurement quantities of the Warfighter Information Network‑Tactical Increment 2, the CH‑53K Heavy Lift Helicopter, or the MQ‑9 Reaper, respectively. The deficiencies identified in the three prior reports demonstrated that the DoD may waste billions of dollars on excess quantities for weapon systems. Therefore, we conducted this audit to review JROC’s procedures for evaluating procurement quantities for MDAPs.  \n",
      "An MDAP is an acquisition program that is designated by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD[AT&L]) or has an estimated total cost of more than $480 million for research, development, test, and evaluation or $2.79 billion for procurement. We nonstatistically selected the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship, the Air Force’s KC‑46A Tanker Modernization, and the Army’s Joint Air‑to‑Ground Missile to review the JROC process for validating requirements documents. \n",
      "The Military Services develop capability requirements documents and submit the documents to JROC for validation. Validation is the review and approval of capability requirements documents by a designated validation authority. The JROC Charter outlines and defines the participants in the JROC validation process. JROC is chaired by the Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and consists of generals and admirals from the Military Services and combatant commands.\n",
      " \n",
      "In 2013, the law was amended and required JROC to assist the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff by ensuring appropriate tradeoffs were made among life‑cycle cost, schedule, performance, and procurement quantity when establishing and approving joint military requirements. This was the first time the law included specific reference to procurement quantity in the JROC responsibilities.  \n",
      "During the audit, Public Law 114‑328, “The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017,” December 23, 2016, amended 10 U.S.C. § 181 (2013) and revised the responsibilities of JROC. As amended, 10 U.S.C. § 181 (2017) transfers JROC’s responsibilities for ensuring appropriate tradeoffs among life‑cycle cost, schedule, performance, and procurement quantity to a new investment review process the Secretary of Defense is required to establish for MDAPs that reach Milestone A after  October 1, 2017. DoD Instruction 5000.02, “Operation of the Defense Acquisition System,” January 7, 2015, defines acquisition Milestone A as an acquisition investment decision to pursue specific product or design concepts, and to commit resources to develop technology and reduce risks before committing resources for system development.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "JROC officials accepted MDAP procurement quantities that were included in requirements documents provided by Military Service acquisition officials but did not obtain input and reviews for procurement quantity from officials within the Office of the Secretary of Defense when validating requirements documents. This occurred because Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System guidance does not define JROC roles and methods for assessing and reviewing procurement quantity. As a result, JROC officials could not ensure that appropriate tradeoffs were made between life‑cycle cost, schedule, performance, and procurement quantity in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 181 (2013).\n",
      "Additionally, JROC officials may validate requirements documents with inaccurate procurement quantities for programs that reached, or will reach, Milestone A on or before October 1, 2017, which could result in the Military Services buying more weapon systems than necessary and wasting billions of dollars. As of March2017, JROC was validating requirements documents for 13 MDAPs with estimated total costs exceeding $140 billion.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff identify the MDAPs that have reached, or will reach, Milestone A on or before October 1, 2017, and will not be affected by the new investment review process required by the FY 2017 change to 10 U.S.C. § 181.\n",

      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provided comments on the finding and stated that requirements oversight is a complex process that includes participation of leaders across the DoD. The Vice Chairman also stated that JROC does not assess nor establish procurement quantities in isolation but rather considers them in the entire context between cost, schedule, performance and procurement quantity to determine the most effective means to satisfy the capability need.\n",
      "The Vice Chairman stated the Joint Staff believes the report was written without a complete understanding of the validation process; contained several misleading statements that implied the JROC process resulted in wasteful spending; and included technical errors in its discussion of several MDAPs.  \n",
      "We agree with the Vice Chairman that requirements oversight is a complex process that includes participation of leaders across the DoD. Overall, however, we found a lack of evidence revealing actual consideration by JROC of procurement quantity. We found no instances where JROC obtained input for procurement quantity from stakeholders and advisors. JROC is the final validation authority on requirements documents that link warfighter needs, acquisition, and funding activities.\n",
      "We concluded that the JROC process for validating procurement quantities may result in inaccurate procurement quantities. Based on the dollar values of the programs we reviewed in this and the previous DoD OIG audit reports we identified, we consider it reasonable to have stated that if JROC validated a requirements document for an MDAP with an inaccurate procurement quantity, billions of dollars could be wasted.\n",
      "The Vice Chairman’s response accepted the recommendations, but did not address the recommendations, or identify a completion date; therefore, the recommendations are unresolved and remain open. We request the Deputy Secretary of Defense and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, specifically address the recommendations by October 6, 2017.  \n",

Joint military requirements are the capabilities necessary to fill or prevent a gap in a DoD core mission area, and requirements documents must describe the quantities of assets required to attain the capability requirements. Therefore, under 10 U.S.C § 181 (2007), JROC has had a duty to assess and review procurement quantity as part of its validation of MDAPs since 2007.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contractors implemented security controls and processes to protect classified and unclassified ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) technical information from internal and external threats. This audit focused on security controls at seven MDA contractor facilities. \n",
      "We conducted this audit in response to a congressional requirement to audit the controls in place to protect classified and unclassified ballistic missile defense technical information, whether managed by cleared Defense contractors or by the Government. This is the first of two audits to determine whether the MDA effectively protects BMDS technical information from unauthorized access and disclosure.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "On April 14, 2016, the MDA Director provided testimony to the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces expressing concern about the potential threat to systems containing BMDS technical information, especially technical information present on cleared Defense contractors’ systems. A cleared Defense contractor is a private company that is given clearance by the DoD to access, receive, or store classified information for the purpose of bidding for a contract or conducting activities in support of any DoD program. The MDA Director stated that cleared Defense contractors may be subject to cyber attacks that allow unauthorized individuals to obtain access to controlled technical information.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "The seven MDA contractors that we audited did not consistently implement security controls and processes to protect classified and unclassified BMDS technical information. Specifically, system and network administrators at the seven contractors that managed BMDS technical information on their classified and unclassified networks did not consistently implement system security controls in accordance with Federal and DoD requirements for safeguarding Defense information. Specifically, we identified issues with:\n",
      "·        the use of multifactor authentication to access networks;\n",
      "·        password configurations;\n",
      "·        the assessment of risk to information systems and assets;\n",
      "·        identifying and mitigating network and system vulnerabilities\n",
      "·        overseeing network and boundary protection services provided by a third-party company;\n",
      "·        transferring controlled technical information to personal electronic devices, such as home computers;\n",
      "·        restricting the use of removable media;\n",
      "·        configuring systems to automatically lock;\n",
      "·        granting system access; and\n",
      "·        maintaining and reviewing system activity logs.\n",
      "Contractor system security controls were ineffective because the MDA did not oversee the contractors’ current or planned actions to protect BMDS technical information on classified and unclassified networks and systems before contract award or during the contract period of performance. If the MDA does not verify and monitor compliance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual requirements, contractors could inadvertently disclose critical technical details of the DoD’s BMDS components to U.S. adversaries and allow them to potentially circumvent the BMDS capabilities, leaving the United States vulnerable to deadly missile attacks.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend, among other recommendations, that the MDA Director for Acquisition:\n",
      "·        Establish a separate technical evaluation factor in the source selection process to evaluate whether an offeror’s approach to securing its networks and systems complied with DFARS clause 252.204-7012.\n",
      "·        Include penalty clauses in awarded contracts to levy monetary sanctions on contractors that fail to implement physical and logical security controls for protecting classified and unclassified BMDS technical information.\n",
      "·        Provide oversight to ensure that contractors comply with the National Institute of Standards and Technology requirements for protecting controlled unclassified information throughout the lifecycle of the contract.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "The MDA Director partially agreed with our finding and recommendations, stating that he disagreed that the MDA plays a role in the contractors’ inability to effectively protect BMDS technical information. However, the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics issued a memorandum related to the implementation of DFARS clause 252.204-7012 that states if an agency determines that oversight related to security requirements is necessary, they may add requirements to the terms of the contract. The significant weaknesses identified in this report support the need for the MDA to oversee the contractors’ compliance with DFARS clause 252.204-7012 and National Institute of Standards and Technology requirements to ensure that the BMDS technical information maintained on contractor systems is protected against unauthorized access and disclosure. Therefore, the MDA Director should provide comments describing how the MDA plans to provide oversight of contractors to ensure compliance with DFARS clause 252.204-7012 and National Institute of Standards and Technology requirements for protecting BMDS technical information.\n",
      "Although the MDA Director agreed with three recommendations, the comments did not address the specifics of the recommendations to:\n",
      "·        submit system security plans and associated plans of action and milestones to verify compliance with DFARS clause 252.204-7012;\n",
      "·        establish a separate technical evaluation factor in the source selection process; and \n",
      "·        take corrective actions against contractors that fail to meet Federal and DoD requirements for protecting classified and unclassified.\n",
      "In addition, the MDA Director Disagreed with recommendations to: \n",
      "·        conduct risk assessments;\n",
      "·        include penalty clauses in awarded contracts; and\n",
      "·        provide oversight to ensure that contractors.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Army maintained and accounted for Army Prepositioned Stock-5 (APS-5) equipment in Kuwait and Qatar. We focused on APS-5 program equipment because the majority of Army support equipment stored and maintained in Kuwait and Qatar is APS equipment.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The APS program is part of the Army’s strategy to maintain combat-ready equipment in strategic locations around the world. The Army’s Care of Supplies in Storage (COSIS) program ensures the readiness of the Army’s stored supplies by identifying and mitigating exposure to temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors so that items in storage remain serviceable and ready to deploy when needed. Army Technical Manual (TM) 38-470 establishes COSIS-prescribed cyclic maintenance schedules for tactical and combat equipment that the Army and supporting contractors are required to implement. \n",
      "Army Contracting Command–Rock Island (ACC‑RI) awarded URS Federal Services (URS) a contract, valued at $393 million, to track and maintain the prescribed cyclic maintenance schedules for equipment in Kuwait and Qatar on August 31, 2016. According to the performance work statement (PWS) for the contract, URS must perform maintenance in accordance with Army TM 38-470, which requires vehicles and weapons to be cared for in a controlled humidity environment and maintained on maintenance cycles specific to the storage environment.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "The Army did not ensure that URS personnel properly maintained the prescribed cyclic maintenance schedules for APS-5 vehicles and weapon systems stored in Kuwait and Qatar. This occurred because 401st Army Field Support Brigade (AFSB) personnel relied on the contractor to adhere to prescribed maintenance schedules and did not verify that the contractor’s maintenance schedules complied with Army TM 38-470 and contract requirements. \n",
      "As a result, the Army does not have assurance that contract personnel are performing the requirements of the contract to maintain vehicles and weapon systems according to the maintenance schedule required for their respective storage conditions. Vehicles and equipment that are not properly maintained are less likely to be operable and combat-ready for deploying units. \n",
      "Furthermore, accountability officers at the 401st AFSB did not consistently account for APS-5 equipment. Specifically, the Army Field Support Batallion–Qatar (AFSBn-Qatar) property accountability officer assumed all responsibilities inherent to the role, including accounting for losses, shortages, and inaccurate accountability, and conducting a 100-percent inventory at transition between accountability officers. However, the Army Field Support Batallion–Kuwait (AFSBn‑Kuwait) property accountability officer did not conduct a 100-percent inventory at transition or assume responsibility for losses, shortages, and inaccurate accountability of APS-5 equipment. \n",
      "This occurred because the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-4 (Logistics), did not clearly establish which inventory accountability requirements apply to APS locations. Instead, the Deputy Chief of Staff relied on Army Material Command and Army Sustainment Command to interpret and implement existing policies that were not clear or did not specifically apply to APS. Without clearly established requirements, Army Sustainment Command provided conflicting guidance to accountability officers for inventory requirements at APS sites.\n",
      "As a result, the Army does not have assurance that it properly accounted for the $5.1 billion worth of APS-5 equipment stored in Kuwait. APS is critical to ensuring that U.S. forces deployed in support of operations in Southwest Asia have what they need when they need it. Mismanagement of the maintenance and monitoring of APS equipment could lead to wasteful replacement costs or equipment that cannot be issued when needed. In addition, the Army is basing future acquisitions and equipment distribution on an inventory that may not be correct, which could lead to unnecessary expenditures and negatively impact equipment readiness.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Chief, Land Based Army Prepositioned Stock Division, Army Sustainment Command, review current oversight procedures and establish appropriate mechanisms for contracting officer representatives to follow for changes in maintenance schedules when a vehicle moves from a controlled humidity environment to a non-controlled humidity environment. \n",
      "Additionally, we recommend that the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-4 (Logistics), in conjunction with the Commander, Army Materiel Command, review Army Technical Manual 38-470 for equipment in the Care of Supplies in Storage program and determine appropriate timeframes for changes in maintenance schedules when equipment is moved from a humidity controlled environment to a non-humidity controlled environment or vice versa. \n",
      "Finally, we recommend that the Chief of Staff of the Army direct the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-4, in conjunction with the Commander, Army Materiel Command, to review and update Army Regulations 710-1, 725-50, 740-26, and 735-5 with procedures to ensure 100-percent accountability of Army Prepositioned Stock equipment.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-4, (Logistics), agreed with our recommendations and stated that the current language in TM 38-470 regarding APS maintenance cycles is not detailed enough. The Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-4 stated that additional information will be added to address specific guidance regarding changes to maintenance cycles when APS equipment is moved from a controlled humidity environment to a non-controlled humidity environment or vice versa. The comments addressed the specifics of our recommendation. Therefore, the recommendation is resolved. We will close the recommendation once we verify that the language has been added to TM 38-470.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) provide a way for the private sector to finance Federal Government energy‑saving projects. The ESPC is a contract type through which an energy services contractor designs, finances, acquires, installs, and maintains energy‑saving equipment and systems for a Federal agency. ESPCs allow Federal agencies to procure energy savings and facility improvements with no upfront capital costs or special appropriations from Congress. \n",
      "An ESPC consists of two phases—the construction phase and the performance phase. During the construction phase, the energy savings contractor constructs the energy conservation measures. At the conclusion of the construction phase, the contractor submits a post-installation report to summarize construction phase issues and outcomes, and identify any energy savings achieved during the phase. The performance phase begins once the energy conservation measures are installed and accepted by the Government.\n",
      "During the performance phase, the contractor will operate and maintain energy improvements, measure the energy savings, and submit measurement and verification reports in accordance with the ESPC. The reports outline the calculation of energy savings and any other evaluation of costs and savings needed to determine the guarantee of savings. The agency is responsible for ESPC administration for the entire term of the ESPC. \n",
      "The Naval Facilities Engineering Command-Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC-EXWC), Port Hueneme, California, manages the Navy ESPC program and performs the contract management functions. The base‑level Public Works Office officials manage installation facilities. As it relates to ESPCs, the base-level public works office performs oversight of the contractor during both the construction and performance phases of the ESPC. Actions performed at the Navy installation public works or contracting office are referred to as “base level” in this report. \n",
      "We non-statistically selected seven ongoing ESPCs valued at $822.7 million from a universe of 50 ongoing ESPCs valued at $ 2.6 billion. The seven ESPCs were located at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, (Main Base and Dam Neck Annex); Marine Corps Logistics Base, Georgia; and Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, to determine whether NAVFAC performed on-site oversight of the ESPCs and tailored quality assurance surveillance plans to the needs of the individual ESPCs. \n",
      "We non-statistically selected three of the seven ESPC projects to review at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, (Main Base and Dam Neck Annex) and Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, Georgia. We determined whether NAVFAC officials verified the energy savings reported in the contractor’s post‑installation and measurement and verification reports were accurate, and that Government payments to the contractor did not exceed the verified savings. The post-installation report is a contractor-submitted report summarizing the project’s construction phase results and identifying any energy savings achieved.\n",
      "For the ESPC detailed review at Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan, we determined whether NAVFAC officials justified and validated contractor‑proposed foreign currency adjustments and whether NAVFAC properly tracked and recorded the adjustments in NAVFAC ESPC value and funding systems.\n",
      " \n",
      "Findings\n",
      "NAVFAC officials did not properly administer seven ESPCs, valued at $ 822.7 million. Specifically, for two ongoing performance-phase ESPC projects, NAVFAC officials did not validate the contractor-claimed energy savings in a contractor post-installation report and 13 of 21 contractor measurement and verification reports, and they did not perform higher-level reviews for 4 of 8 base-level validation reports. This occurred because NAVFAC officials and base-level public works office officials did not prioritize validating the contractor’s post-installation and measurement and verification reports. As a result, the two ESPC projects include $22 million in questionable ESPC payments and did not fully comply with section 8287, title 42, United States Code. \n",
      "NAVFAC contracting officials did not tailor quality assurance surveillance plans to the specifics of each implemented energy conservation measure, describe how to validate contractor-submitted energy-savings reports, and oversee contractor maintenance, repair, and replacement of energy conservation measures. This occurred because NAVFAC officials and base-level PWO officials did not emphasize the need to tailor quality assurance surveillance plans. By not tailoring quality assurance surveillance plans, contracting officials may cause inconsistent validation of contractor-claimed energy savings reporting and inadequate oversight of ESPC contractor performance. \n",
      "Contracting and base public works office officials did not properly validate 9 of 11 contractor-proposed currency escalation modifications for the ESPC at Commander Fleet Activities Yokosuka. Specifically, NAVFAC officials did not justify or validate nine contractor proposals for annual yen currency adjustment valued at $6.7 million. This occurred because contracting officials did not apply the contractual escalation clauses, which consider and account for changes to the contract price resulting from annual changes to the yen and U.S. dollar exchange rates. \n",
      "In addition, contracting officials did not properly track and record the resulting adjustments to the ESPC resulting from yen currency changes. This occurred because contracting officials did not make required manual adjustments in the electronic accounting system to explain the currency rate adjustments on future payments. As a result, NAVFAC overpaid the contractor $250,000 in annual currency adjustment payments. Additionally, NAVFAC contracting officials issued contract modifications that overstated the ESPC value by $760,000. \n",
      "In addition to this report’s findings on the lack of oversight of the NAVFAC ESPC, we previously reported similar weaknesses related to Navy and Air Force oversight of ESPC contracting and project management in three prior reports. Specifically, the Navy and Air Force officials did not validate the contractor‑claimed energy savings in a contractor post-installation report and contractor measurement and verification reports. Furthermore, Navy and Air Force contracting officials did not develop a quality assurance surveillance plan that provided specifics on how to oversee each implemented energy conservation measure or determine how to validate the contractor post-installation reports and contractor measurement and verification reports. As a result, neither the Navy nor Air Force contracting officials knew whether multiple ESPC projects achieved the contractor-claimed energy savings.\n",

We also recommend that the Assistant Secretary coordinate with the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy to require oversight of ESPCs through development of quality assurance surveillance plans and monitor ESPC programs to ensure consistent award and administration throughout the Department. \n",
      "Furthermore, we recommend that the Commander, NAVFAC, direct program and contracting officials to validate and perform required higher-level reviews of $22 million in contractor-guaranteed energy‑savings payments over 14 performance periods for two ESPCs.

      "We determined whether the contracts and task orders related to the Utility Energy Services Contracts (UESCs) were properly awarded and administered. This is the third in a series of audits related to the DoD’s use of UESCs. UESCs allow Federal agencies to contract with utility companies to reduce energy consumption. DoD Components are authorized to manage energy demand or conserve energy by participating in programs provided by any gas or electric utility company. We are conducting this audit in response to allegations made to the Defense Hotline. The allegations stated that Marine Corps Base (MCB) Camp Pendleton, California, Energy Office officials did not have adequate internal controls in place to ensure the proper award and administration of UESCs implemented at MCB Camp Pendleton. We reviewed 10 UESCs implementing energy projects at Camp Pendleton, valued at $44.6 million, awarded between FY 2009 and FY 2015.\n",
      "Findings\n",
      "Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest contracting officials properly awarded and justified the 10 UESCs reviewed. Specifically, contracting officials appropriately solicited and evaluated proposals for the implementation of energy conservation measures at MCB Camp Pendleton. However, NAVFAC Southwest contracting officials did not adequately administer the 10 UESCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 6 of the 10 UESCs, valued at $25.9 million, the NAVFAC Southwest contracting officers did not approve scope of work changes before the contractor implemented the changes and did not modify the UESCs to reflect the scope of work changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For 9 of 10 UESCs, valued at $39.8 million, NAVFAC Southwest contracting officers did not appoint contracting officer’s representatives to monitor contractor performance and provide contract surveillance during the contract period of performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This occurred because NAVFAC Southwest contracting officers relied solely on the NAVFAC Southwest project manager and Facilities Engineering and Acquisition Division officials to monitor contractor performance and perform quality assurance but did not have controls in place to identify potential changes to scope of work or concerns about the contractor’s performance. In addition, NAVFAC Southwest contracting officers did not appoint contracting officer’s representatives for the UESCs because the NAVFAC Southwest contracting officers’ understanding was that they were not required to appoint contracting officer’s representatives for utility service contracts.\n",
      "As a result, NAVFAC Southwest contracting officials and MCB Camp Pendleton Energy Office officials did not have reasonable assurance that changes in scope of work were in the best interest of the Government and provided the best alternative to the original scope of work. In addition, the officials did not have reasonable assurance that the Government and contractor received fair consideration for the changes in the scope of work and that the contractor met the contract terms and conditions.\n",
      "Moreover, for the 10 UESCs we reviewed, MCB Camp Pendleton Energy Office officials did not have an existing process to track the savings generated by individual energy conservation measures or by individual UESC. MCB Camp Pendleton Energy Office officials’ stated that they did not track energy savings for the individual UESCs or energy conservation measures because their understanding of UESC guidance was that they were not required to track the generated energy savings. As a result, MCB Camp Pendleton officials could not support that they achieved sufficient energy savings to pay back their $44.6 million investment in energy conservation measures.\n",

      "In addition, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Energy, Installations, and Environment) responding for the Commanding General, Marine Corps Installation West–MCB Camp Pendleton, disagreed with our recommendation to develop and implement a system to convert energy usage to cost and realized energy savings for each UESC. The Assistant Secretary stated that the DoD disagreed with a similar recommendation cited in a Government Accountability Office audit report. The Assistant Secretary used the same context for his disagreement with our recommendation, stating that there is no statutory requirement for annual measurement and verification of the energy, water, or cost savings or contractual guarantee of the savings. He concluded that UESCs are for utility services and the only financial requirement is the obligation of the annual costs for the UESC. In addition, he stated that the MCB Camp Pendleton would implement the use of performance assurance plans as recommended by the Department of the Energy Federal Energy Management Program. Furthermore, as the command responsible for developing policy, instruction, and guidance on UESCs for the Marine Corps, the Commander, Marine Corps Installations Command, will issue guidance that will incorporate steps recommended by the Department of the Energy Federal Energy Management Program for developing and implementing performance assurance plans for UESCs.\n",
      "Comments from the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Energy, Installations, and Environment) did not address the specifics of the recommendation. We agree there is no statutory requirement for annual measurement and verification of the savings or a contractual agreement of those savings; however, we disagree that there is no requirement to track energy savings achieved through UESCs. Specifically, Section 2912, title 10, United States Code states an amount of appropriated funds for the fiscal year equal to the amount of energy cost savings realized by the DoD shall remain available for obligation until spent.1  In addition, Federal Energy Management Program guidance requires that an agency pay for the cost of the UESC from savings generated from the ECMs during the contract period.2  Finally, DoD Instruction 4170.11 requires tracking the estimated and verified energy savings generated by implementing energy projects.3  In order for a UESC to comply with Section 2912, title 10, United States Code, the Federal Energy Management Program guidance, and DoD Instruction 4170.11, MCB Camp Pendleton Energy officials would need to track energy savings generated from the individual ECMs.\n",
      "In addition, performance assurance plans alone are not sufficient to comply with applicable UESC guidance. According to the Department of the Energy Federal Energy Management Program guidance, performance assurance plans define actions to be taken during the contract to achieve the expected performance of the energy conservation measures implemented under the UESC. By developing and implementing performance assurance plans, MCB Camp Pendleton officials assert a commitment in reaching the estimated savings of a UESC; however, they do not measure actual energy savings achieved after implementation of energy conservation measures. Therefore, by using the performance assurance plans, MCB Camp Pendleton Energy officials cannot clearly determine whether the energy conservation measures implemented through UESCs achieved sufficient savings. Therefore, the recommendation is unresolved and remains open.\n",
      "We request that the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Energy, Installations, and Environment) provide comments on the final report that specifically address the issue of MCB Camp Pendleton Energy Office officials not supporting whether energy conservation measures achieved sufficient energy savings. We request that the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Energy, Installations, and Environment), provide comments to the final report by October 30, 2017.\n",

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined the accuracy of the Navy’s obligations and disbursements supporting Operation Freedom’s Sentinel (OFS), as reported, for select Navy appropriations, in the Cost of War (CoW) report.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "We performed this audit to determine the accountability of DoD funds supporting overseas contingency operations (OCO), as required by the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended.\n",
      "Under OFS, an OCO that began January 1, 2015, U.S. Forces transitioned from a combat mission to a train, advise, and assist mission for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. OFS also supports counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al Qaeda and its associates.\n",
      "Findings\n",
      "The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller), Deputy Assistant Secretary of Financial Operations, Accounting and Financial Reporting Division, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget could not support $866.3 million (91.3 percent) in obligations reported in the first quarter FY 2016 CoW reports. This occurred because they did not establish adequate processes to identify transactions for OCOs within the Standard Accounting and Reporting System–Field Level, a Navy accounting system.  As a result, the Navy could not provide assurance that it accurately reported the OFS obligations and disbursements to Congress for first quarter FY 2016, and it could not ensure accountability for the spending of OCO funds.\n",
      "Our review of the Navy’s internal controls identified significant inaccuracies within the Navy’s first quarter FY 2016 CoW reports.  Specifically, the Navy inaccurately reported $20.1 million in obligations and $85.4 million in disbursements for first quarter FY 2016 due to the lack of adequate standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n",
      "Additionally, the Navy inappropriately reported more than the incremental costs in the CoW report. Incremental costs are additional costs to the DoD that would not have been incurred if the contingency operation had not been supported.  Public Law 113-235, as implemented in the DoD Financial Management Regulation, volume 12, chapter 23, limits the DoD to reporting incremental contingency operation costs for OFS in the CoW report.  The Navy misstated the costs reported because Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget personnel did not include the requirement to limit reporting to incremental costs in its implementing guidance.\n",
      "The Navy could not identify all transactions for Navy OCOs which impacted us determining the full amount of the misstatements reported in the CoW report.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "Deputy Assistant Secretary of Financial Operations, Accounting and Financial Reporting Division, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, in coordination with the Comptroller, Pacific Fleet Command, and the Comptroller, U.S. Fleet Forces Command, should reengineer processes to identify all transactions for Navy OCOs.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, in coordination with budget submitting offices and support activities, should develop and implement SOPs that cover end-to-end CoW reporting processes.  Furthermore, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget should develop and implement a consistent methodology to report only incremental costs.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Associate Director for the Office of Budget, responding for the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Financial Operations, Accounting and Financial Reporting Division, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, agreed with our findings and recommendations.\n",
      "The Associate Director stated that the transition to the Standard Accounting, Budgeting, and Reporting System (SABRS), the Marine Corps’ accounting system, and development and implementation of SOPs would allow the Navy to identify all transactions for OCOs.  The Navy anticipates the completion of the SABRS transition for Fleet Commands in FY 2019 and the development and implementation of SOPs by June 30, 2017.  However, the Associate Director did not provide the procedures they will implement to identify Navy’s OCO transactions prior to the transition to SABRS. Therefore, the recommendation is unresolved.\n",
      "In addition, the Naval Audit Service is currently conducting an audit of the Marine Corps obligations and disbursements supporting OFS and should be able to verify whether SABRS can produce a universe of OCO transactions supporting the CoW report.  Therefore, we will close this recommendation once the Naval Audit Service verifies that SABRS can produce a universe of Marine Corps OCO transactions, we verify that SABRS can produce a universe of Navy OCO transactions, and we verify that the SOPs clearly identify the methodology for calculating operational costs allocated to OCOs.\n",
      "The Associate Director also agreed that an updated SOP is required and has already started updating the SOP and existing guidance.  Therefore, the recommendation is resolved and remains open. We will close this recommendation once we are provided a copy of the new SOP and verify that it includes procedures for the receipt, review, and reporting of obligations and disbursements for the CoW reports.\n",
      "Furthermore, the Associate Director agreed to develop revised guidance for determining and reporting incremental costs.  Therefore, the recommendation is resolved and remains open. We will close this recommendation once we receive the new guidance from the Associate Director and verify that it identifies a consistent methodology for allocating and documenting operational costs for OCOs.\n",
      "Because management comments did not fully address the recommendation to reengineer processes to identify Navy OCO transactions, we request that the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Financial Operations, Accounting and Financial Reporting Division, and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget address the recommendation specifics by March 31, 2017.\n",

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the Department of the Navy properly awarded and obtained fair market value for leases supporting energy production projects.\n",
      "We conducted this audit based on an allegation reported to the Defense Hotline. The allegation stated that the Army and Navy leased land to utility companies without using competitive procedures to select the lessee, and the Army and Navy are not receiving rent greater than or equal to the fair market value of the land. We previously audited Army leases supporting energy production projects in report DODIG-2016-137.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "The United States Code allows the Secretaries of the Military Departments to lease non-excess property when the Secretary determines that the property is not currently needed for public use, that the lease is advantageous to the United States, and that the lease will promote national defense or be in the public interest. The same statute requires that the Secretaries of the Military Departments use competitive procedures to select the lessees and that the lessees pay in cash or in-kind consideration greater than or equal to the fair market value of the leased property. In-kind consideration is nonmonetary compensation given as payment for the leased land.\n",
      "As of October 5, 2016, the Navy executed 11 leases of real property in support of energy projects, and we selected 10 of those 11 leases for review. We did not review the remaining lease because a DoD OIG team reviewed it during a prior audit.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "We determined that Navy Resilient Energy Program Office officials properly awarded the 10 leases reviewed supporting energy production projects in accordance with the United States Code. Specifically, Navy Resilient Energy Program Office officials issued solicitations, evaluated proposals, and obtained approval to award the leases.\n",
      "In addition, the Navy will obtain fair market value for 10 leases supporting energy production projects if the Navy receives payment in the form of the agreed upon in-kind consideration. However, for 3 of the 10 leases, if the Navy does not receive payment in the form of in-kind consideration, the Navy will not receive cash payments greater than or equal to the fair market value of the land. This occurred because a Navy real estate contracting officer did not use the correct acreage to develop the rent schedule in two of the leases. For the third lease, the Navy real estate contracting officer modified the lease to increase the acreage but did not update the cash payment rent schedule. As a result, if the Navy does not receive payment in the form of in-kind consideration, the Navy will receive $290,000 less than the fair market value of the land.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Director, Navy Resilient Energy Program Office direct the real estate contracting officer to modify the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, lease to include the revised acreage or modify the lease to include a revised rent schedule developed using the acreage awarded in the lease. In addition, we recommend that the Director, Navy Resilient Energy Program Office direct the real estate contracting officer to modify the Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, Georgia, and Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, leases to include a revised rent schedule developed using the acreage awarded in the lease. Furthermore, we recommend that the Director, Navy Resilient Energy Program Office, develop a process to ensure Navy real estate contracting officers update the lease rent schedule when Navy Resilient Energy Program Office officials revise the lease acreage.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Defense Health Agency (DHA) properly awarded noncompetitive Information Technology (IT) contracts.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "Full and open competition is the preferred method for Federal agencies to award contracts. However, the United States Code includes certain exceptions for awarding contracts without full and open competition. For example, Federal agencies may award contracts without full and open competition to a small business participating in a program sponsored by the Small Business Administration (SBA), such as the 8(a) Program for small, disadvantaged businesses. \n",
      "We reviewed all 27 noncompetitive IT contracts, valued at $329.6 million, awarded by the DHA Contracting Office–Health Information Technology (CO-HIT) at Joint Base San Antonio–Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas between October 1, 2015 and July 27, 2017.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "DHA CO-HIT contracting personnel properly awarded 23 noncompetitive IT contracts, valued at $87.2 million, of the 27 contracts reviewed. For 16 contracts, valued at $81.3 million, DHA CO-HIT contracting personnel properly awarded the contracts as sole-source under the 8(a) Program and coordinated with the SBA. Additionally, DHA CO-HIT contracting personnel properly awarded seven contracts, valued at $5.9 million, using another Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) authority, which permitted contracting without providing for full and open competition. However, the DHA CO-HIT contracting personnel did not properly award four contracts, valued at $242.3 million, of the 27 contracts reviewed. \n",
      "For one contract, valued at $237.9 million, the DHA CO-HIT contracting officer did not appropriately apply the sole-source authority cited, include all of the minimum FAR content requirements in the justification, or properly award a bridge contract. This occurred because the DHA used multiple contracting offices before awarding the contract. Furthermore, the DHA knew about the requirement for 2 years; however, it did not adequately communicate the requirement before the previous task order expired. This led the awarding contracting officer to overlook market research that identified other potential capable sources. In addition, the contracting officer stated that he had other priorities that prevented him from determining a fair and reasonable price. The DHA also had minimal guidance on bridge contracts. \n",
      "For three other contracts, valued at $4.4 million, DHA CO-HIT contracting personnel did not meet one of the FAR criteria for the authority cited by not determining a fair and reasonable price or appropriately advertising award opportunities. DHA CO-HIT contracting personnel stated that this occurred because they had competing priorities from multiple procurements and they overlooked performing all applicable requirements. \n",
      "As a result, DHA contracting officials should have awarded the contract valued at $237.9 million, using full and open competition. In addition, for all four contracts, the DoD may have paid a lower price for the IT services received or increased future competition, if the DHA CO-HIT contracting personnel had performed their due diligence in determining fair and reasonable prices and appropriately advertised award opportunities.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Head of the Contracting Activity, Defense Health Agency review the contract actions taken for the one contract, valued at $237.9 million, and determine whether the contract should be terminated and awarded using full and open competition; issue guidance on the use of bridge contracts; and develop procedures for defining minimum timeframes for procurements.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Acting Component Acquisition Executive (J-4), Defense Health Agency, agreed with our recommendations. The Head of the Contracting Activity reviewed the contract action to sustain Secure Messaging Software as a Service and determined not to terminate and re-announce the contract for competition. The Head of the Contracting Activity plans to publish a Procurement Directive to provide policy guidance on the use of bridge contracts. The Head of the Contracting Activity will also perform a review that considers whether to develop refined procedures that ensure adequate time to properly evaluate and award contracts.\n",
      "The recommendations are resolved but remain open. The recommendations will be closed when we verify the actions are fully implemented and review the support for the planned or already conducted actions. Additionally, the Acting Component Acquisition Executive commented on the internal control weaknesses we identified and described DHA internal control processes related to the internal control weaknesses we identified. Although some key internal control processes were in place, we concluded that some controls were not always implemented, and some additional controls were required to address problems identified.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) properly reviewed contractor invoices for work performed under a support contract for the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack (EMP Commission III). The Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives, requested that we conduct this audit. After discussions with staff from the Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives, we focused our audit on reviewing time charges for one subject matter expert (SME) employed by the support contractor.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The EMP Commission III identifies steps it believes should be taken by the U.S. Government to better protect military and civilian systems from EMP attack. An EMP attack could involve a burst of electromagnetic radiation created by nuclear explosions. An EMP can temporarily disrupt or permanently damage electronic equipment by generating high voltage and high current surges. The effects of immediate damage can range from imperceptible to the eye to devices being blown apart.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "We determined that the WHS contracting officer did not effectively review contractor invoices for work performed under the support contract. Specifically, one SME employed by the support contractor submitted questionable hours on time cards. WHS contracting officials:\n",
      "\n",
      "directed the contracting officer’s representative (COR) to approve payment requests for a contractor SME that included hours beyond an 8-hour day, 40-hour week, including hours claimed on holidays and weekends, even though the COR had concerns about the reasonableness of those hours,\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "did not require the contractor to submit payment requests to the Defense Contract Audit Agency for review and approval. The contracting officer stated that this was an oversight, and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "relied on the signatures from the EMP Commission III Chair and the contractor to support all hours submitted by one SME, without obtaining documentation supporting the hours worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "These deficiencies occurred because the WHS contracting officials used the wrong sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to justify payments to the contractor and incorrectly believed that they had to pay the contractor for all hours that the SME submitted on his time cards because the order was a time-and-materials order. In addition, we identified two potential Antideficiency Act violations that may have occurred. The first violation, valued at $15,645, may have occurred in May 2017 when the SME claimed 149 hours after the subcontract between the SME and the contractor ran out of funds. The second violation, valued at $22,680, may have occurred in July 2017 when the SME performed “pro bono” (voluntary) services that were not permitted by the contract or authorized by statute.\n",
      "As a result, WHS contracting officials might have paid the contractor $118,755 more than it should have because it paid for claimed work past 40 hours in a workweek and may have to pay for the unpaid hours that the SME submitted on his time card for May 2017, and the voluntary services performed in July 2017.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",

In addition, the WHS modified the order to require the contractor to submit invoices to the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Therefore, the recommendation to modify the order is closed. The WHS Deputy Director also agreed that it would be improper to allow payment for work under a previous contract to be paid under a future EMP Commission contract. Therefore, he stated that, if WHS receives a future request for support, the administering division and contracting support team (to include the contracting officer, contract specialist, and contracting officer’s representative) will be advised to review and approve invoices consistent with regulation. Therefore, the recommendation to ensure that any future contract for services in support of future EMP Commission requirements does not allow hours worked on previous contracts to be paid under the contract is closed.

      "We determined whether Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Disposition Services properly processed and disposed of equipment in Kuwait.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The DLA’s mission is to provide effective and efficient worldwide support to warfighters and other customers. As part of this support, the DLA offers equipment disposition, including equipment turn-in; reutilization, transfer, and donation; and sales. Reutilization, transfer, and donation of equipment saves the DoD substantial procurement and repair costs, and benefits the Military Services, Federal agencies, state and local governments, nonprofit agencies, and American taxpayers. \n",
      "DLA Disposition Services sites dispose of all DoD-generated excess, surplus, foreign excess, and other personal property authorized for turn-in. DLA Disposition Services headquarters in Battle Creek, Michigan, develops and updates guidance and procedures for processing and disposing of equipment. \n",
      "DLA Disposition Services Kuwait, located in DLA Disposition Services’ Central disposal region, provides services in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The DLA Disposition Services site at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, is one of the largest DLA disposition sites in the world. The disposition process in Kuwait starts with a pre-receipt process, in which DLA Disposition Services Kuwait officials travel to the customer to preview equipment and ensure all required turn-in documents are prepared correctly. A DLA Disposition Services’ official provides an internal DLA Disposition Services reference number to the customer to schedule an appointment. The customer then turns in the equipment to DLA Disposition Services Kuwait during the scheduled appointment, and the equipment is either reutilized, scrapped, or demilitarized. \n",
      "Because of hazards associated with the disposition process such as cuts, loss of eyes and limbs, and head injuries, DLA Disposition Services Kuwait officials must implement Occupational Safety and Health Program requirements. Specifically, DLA Instruction 6055.01 requires DLA Disposition Service Kuwait officials to report and track all hazards, conduct personal protective equipment assessments, and ensure that safe work practices are followed\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "We determined that DLA Disposition Services officials properly processed and disposed of equipment in Kuwait; however, improvements are necessary to mitigate life, health, and safety hazards. Specifically, DLA Disposition Services Kuwait officials did not consistently:\n",
      "\n",
      "ensure personnel responsible for disposing of equipment wore the required personal protective equipment; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "conduct annual Job Hazard Analysis reviews and identify and develop Job Hazard Analyses for DLA Disposition Services officials as required by DLA guidance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This occurred because the Director, DLA Disposition Services Directorate—Central did not ensure officials provided comprehensive oversight of employees and contractors’ adherence and implementation of safety requirements.\n",
      "As a result, DLA Disposition Services Kuwait officials and Gulf Civilization General Trading contractors responsible for disposing of equipment in Kuwait are susceptible to significant injuries. For example, a contractor suffered temporary hearing loss and a cut finger during cutting operations. According to signs in the cutting area, safety gloves and respiratory mask are required within 45 feet of ongoing operations. DLA Disposition Services’ Kuwait officials did not specify whether the contractor was wearing proper personal protective equipment at the time the incident was reported. Yet, without proper personal protective equipment contractors in similar incidents are at increased risk of injuries. To prevent additional injuries from occurring, DLA Disposition Services Kuwait officials must increase oversight of contractors’ adherence to safety requirements to mitigate hazards. \n",
      "In addition, DLA Disposition Services Kuwait officials established site-specific pre-receipt processes that resulted in equipment turn-in efficiencies, such as reduced backlog and processing times, but did not document this process. Failure to document site‑specific processes increases the risk of backlogs of equipment awaiting turn-in and longer processing times. For example, DLA Disposition Services Kuwait officials may not accept equipment that arrives without the proper documents and will either send the equipment back with the customer or hold it onsite until the customer provides the proper documentation, resulting in delays. In addition, if these processes are not documented, future rotations of DLA Disposition Services Kuwait officials may not continue these best practices.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Director, DLA Disposition Services Directorate—Central:\n",

The Director, DLA Disposition Services Directorate—Central provided supervisors and employees training on Job Hazard Analyses for their applicable areas of oversight. DLA Disposition Services’ officials also developed a Job Hazard Analysis for shredding operations.

      "The AH-64E Apache is an Army two-pilot, four‑blade attack and reconnaissance helicopter. The Apache fleet consists of two models, the AH-64D and AH-64E; however, the Army plans to replace the AH-64D with the AH-64E. The AH-64E program consists of two Major Defense Acquisition Programs—one Major Defense Acquisition Program for remanufactured AH-64Es and one for new build AH-64Es. The remanufacturing program upgrades an existing AH-64D to the AH-64E model, while the new build program produces an AH-64E with all new parts. \n",
      "The five offices that share responsibility for determining the correct required quantities for the AH-64E Apache Program are the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-8 (Resource Management); the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-3/5/7 (Operations, Plans, and Training); the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-4 (Logistics); the Training and Doctrine Command; and the Apache Program Office. \n",
      "The Army procures quantities of equipment according to its acquisition objective. The AH-64E acquisition objective is broken down into four sub-categories: operating, training, float, and test. The Army uses float helicopters to provide a temporary replacement when AH-64Es need maintenance, modification, or repair.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "G-8 and G-3/5/7 officials justified planned procurement quantities of the AH-64Es designated for regular Army and Army National Guard operational fleets. However, G-8, G-3/5/7, and G-4 officials could not justify the planned procurement quantities of 85 training, 67 float, and 15 test AH-64Es. This occurred because G-8, G-3/5/7, and G-4 officials did not conduct the analyses required by DoD and Army guidance to determine the necessary training, float, and test quantities before the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-8, approved the Army Acquisition Objective on June 15, 2017. As a result, G-8 officials cannot ensure that 167 AH-64Es for training, float, and test, valued at $3.5 billion, will meet the needs of the Army. Additionally, G-8 officials have no assurance that the AH-64E program is affordable. If too many AH-64Es are procured, the Army could be wasting DoD funds that could be put to better use. If too few AH-64Es are procured, the Army may not be able to train enough pilots to meet Army operational needs, provide replacements for AH-64Es that cannot be repaired in time to meet readiness objectives, or test and evaluate other weapon systems that are added to the AH-64E.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-8: \n",
      "\n",
      "review and validate that G-3/5/7 and G-4 officials can justify the training, float, and test quantities of AH-64Es before approving; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "prepare and retain supporting documentation for decisions to approve the Army Acquisition Objective; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "coordinate with G-3/5/7 officials to assess affordability and ensure that the planned procurement quantity is a sustainable investment decision. \n",
      "\n",
      "We recommend that the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-3/5/7:\n",
      "\n",
      "coordinate with U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence and the Apache Program Office to determine the necessary AH-64E training and test quantities; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "analyze the supportability, affordability, and feasibility of AH-64Es to determine the necessary training and test quantities and submit changes to G-8 for approval; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "review and approve the float quantities determined by the G-4 officials to ensure that they are based on mission needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recommend that the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, G-4:\n",
      "\n",
      "analyze and determine the AH-64E quantity necessary for float and submit to G-3/5/7 and G-8 officials for approval; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "review and determine whether the float calculations in Army Regulation 750-1 should be updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Management Actions Taken:\n",
      "The Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, responding for the Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army, G-8, G-3/5/7, and G-4, agreed with all of the recommendations and stated that the Army:\n",
      "\n",
      "conducted a review of Army Acquisition Objective regulations and policies and has updated the methodology to determine the Army Acquisition Objective;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "developed simplified demand-based formulas for training, Operational Readiness Float and Repair Cycle Float; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "determined a baseline quantity of AH-64Es required to support the test fleet, which will be adjusted during the annual revalidation of the Army Acquisition Objective. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army stated that the Army plans to:\n",
      "\n",
      "publish a policy letter requiring annual revalidation of Army Acquisition Objective documents;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "capture revalidation results in a written execution order that documents the G-8, G-3/5/7, and G-4 analysis; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ensure that affordability assessments of planned procurement quantities are sustainable based on future budget expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army did not specify how the Army will conduct and review its analysis to ensure that AH-64E quantities for training, float, and test will meet the needs of the Army. Further, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army partially addressed our recommendation that G-8, G-3/5/7, and G-4 officials prepare and retain supporting documentation for decisions to approve the Army Acquisition Objective, but did not specify that supporting documentation would be retained. \n",
      "In addition, on May 14, 2018, the G-8 revised the Army Acquisition Objective and determined that the planned procurement quantity for AH-64Es is 188 (100 for training, 81 for float, and 7 for test). However, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army did not provide any analysis to support that the planned procurement quantity reflects the Army’s actual needs for training, float, and test fleets across the program’s life cycle. Therefore, nine recommendations remain unresolved. \n",
      "In addition, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army agreed to update the float calculations in Army regulations. Therefore, the recommendation to update the regulation is resolved but will remain open until we verify that Army Regulation 750-1 has been updated with the new formulas.\n",

      "We determined whether the Departments of the Navy and Air Force designed and implemented effective security protocols to protect electronic health records (EHRs) and individually identifiable health information (patient health information[PHI]) from unauthorized access and disclosure. This report is the second in a series of reports on security protocols used by the Military Departments for protecting EHR and PHI systems. The first report (DODIG-2017-085) identified that the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and the Army did not consistently implement effective security protocols to protect systems that stored, processed, and transmitted PHI.  \n",
      "Background:\n",
      "We visited three Navy facilities—Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, Camp Pendleton, California; San Diego Naval Medical Center, San Diego, California; and the U.S. Naval Ship (USNS) Mercy, San Diego, California; and two Air Force facilities, the 436th Medical Group, Dover, Delaware; and Wright-Patterson Medical Center, Dayton, Ohio.  We reviewed 17 information systems at the 5 locations:  3 DoD EHR systems, 3 modified EHR systems used aboard the USNS Mercy, 2 DHA owned, and 9 Service specific systems.  \n",

      "Officials from the DHA, Navy, and Air Force did not consistently implement security protocols to protect systems that stored, processed, and transmitted EHRs and PH for a variety of reasons including lack of resources and guidance, system incompatibility, and vendor limitations. \n",
      "Without well-defined, effectively implemented system security protocols, the DHA, Navy, and Air Force compromised the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of PHI.  In addition, ineffective administrative, technical, and physical security protocols that result in a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 could cost the MTFs up to $1.5 million per year in penalties for each category of violation.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Director, DHA, configure the DoD EHR systems and other DHA owned systems that process, store, and transmit PHI to automatically lock after 15 minutes of inactivity.\n",

We reviewed a nonstatistical sample of 50 contracts with estimated completion dates in FYs 2015 or 2016 and 30 contracts awarded in FY 2016. This audit is the fourth and last in a series of our audits on DoD small business contracting.\n",

      "ACC-Redstone and ACC-Warren contracting officials ensured that prime contractors provided small businesses with adequate subcontracting opportunities for 27 of 50 contracts we reviewed, valued at $693.5 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. \n",
      "However, ACC-Redstone and ACC-Warren contracting officials did not ensure that prime contractors provided small businesses with adequate subcontracting opportunities for the remaining 23 contracts, valued at $914.8 million. Specifically, ACC-Redstone and ACC-Warren contracting officials: \n",
      "\n",
      "awarded six contracts, valued at $330.7 million, without a subcontracting plan or a contracting officer’s determination that no subcontracting possibilities existed;\n",
      "did not monitor prime contractors’ compliance with subcontracting plans for 11 contracts, valued at $480.3 million;\n",

      "did not determine why prime contractors with individual subcontracting plans did not meet their small business subcontracting goals for five contracts, valued at $81.6 million; and \n",
      "accepted an individual subcontracting report for one contract, valued at $22.1 million, that may have misreported subcontract awards. \n",
      "\n",
      "ACC-Redstone and ACC-Warren contracting officials stated that this occurred because contracting officials did not understand subcontracting plan requirements and because administering subcontracting plans was not a high priority. In addition, ACC-Redstone and ACC-Warren had high turnover among their contracting staffs, and subcontracting plan administration guidance at both locations did not address the transfer of duties from one contracting officer to another. Also, ACC-Redstone contracting management did not provide adequate training or standard operating procedures on requirements for administering subcontracting plans. \n",
      "As a result, small businesses may have been denied subcontracting opportunities that prime contractors were required to make a good-faith effort to provide. ACC-Redstone and ACC-Warren contracting officials did not obtain subcontracting reports, did not follow up on reports that showed contractors were not meeting their small business goals, and did not determine whether prime contractors made good-faith efforts to comply with negotiated subcontracting goals. Therefore, ACC-Redstone and ACC-Warren may have missed opportunities to recoup liquidated damages (the amount paid by a contractor that fails to make a good-faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan) of up to $82.3 million.\n",

      "The Navy did not have an information technology strategy to effectively manage its financial management systems. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 requires Federal agencies to prepare annual financial statements and requires the financial statements to be audited. However, Navy personnel continued to use financial management systems that did not comply with standards to support the preparation of auditable financial statements. In addition, the Navy and Defense Finance and Accounting Service’s costs to maintain systems and develop new functionality in the Navy’s decentralized multiple systems environment were expensive.\n",
      "This occurred because the Navy did not have an enterprise-wide approach to managing its financial management systems. Instead, the Navy allowed its commands to develop and select their own systems. As a result, the Navy and Defense Finance and Accounting Service spent $2.5 billion over the last decade and plan to spend an additional $823.4 million over the next 5 years on maintaining and developing new functionality for Navy financial management systems that are not compliant with the standards that might not support auditable financial statements and not meet the congressional mandate to have auditable financial statements by September 30, 2017.\n",

      "In FY 2008, the DoD Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported on DoD officials not complying with past performance reporting requirements.  In 2010, the Senate Armed Services Committee requested that the DoD OIG perform a followup audit. To address the Committee’s request, we performed a series of audits on DoD officials’ compliance with past performance requirements. This is the capstone report for our audits.\n",

At the 18 offices, we nonstatistically selected and reviewed 1,264 contracts, valued at $168.2 billion, and 238 PARs prepared for those contracts, valued at $18.0 billion.\n",

      "Navy, Air Force, Army, and Defense organization officials generally registered, or had a valid reason for not registering, contracts and generally prepared PARs for contracts that required an evaluation. However, DoD officials did not consistently comply with requirements for evaluating contractor performance when preparing PARs from May 2013 through May 2016.  Of the 238 PARs we reviewed, DoD officials prepared 83 PARs an average of 73 days late. In addition, DoD officials did not prepare 200 of the 238 PARs in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Guidance for the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS Guide). Specifically, DoD officials did not:\n",
      "\n",
      "prepare written narratives sufficient to justify the ratings given,\n",
      "rate required evaluation factors, and\n",
      "prepare sufficient contract effort descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "These conditions occurred because:\n",
      "\n",
      "assessors were not adequately trained and organizations lacked effective procedures for timeliness and reviews of the PARs; and\n",
      "there was a lack of internal controls within CPARS—no system requirement to write a narrative and insufficient explanations for the different ratings—and the CPARS Guide did not contain sufficient information related to the utilization of small business.1\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, Federal source selection officials did not have access to timely, accurate, and complete past performance assessment information needed to make informed decisions related to contract awards.  In addition, unreliable data in CPARS may lead to awarding a contract to a poorly performing contractor.  \n",

CSTC-A and the Afghan ministries enter into annual agreements known as the Bilateral Financial Commitment Letters. In the commitment letters, CSTC-A commits to funding specified portions of each ministry’s budget, and each ministry commits to stated conditions and provisions to ensure continued funding.

CSTC-A management and oversight of U.S. direct funding is intended to increase ANDSF effectiveness and capabilities so the ANDSF can become more professional and increasingly self-sustaining. The DoD OIG’s seven reports identified systemic challenges related to CSTC-A officials’ management and oversight of the U.S. direct funding provided to the MoD and MoI to obtain and maintain items such as fuel, ammunition, vehicles, and other commodities.

      "Background\n",
      "Operating Material and Supplies (OM&S) assets include ammunition, missiles, and related spare and repair parts. The Army is responsible for the storage, safeguarding, and demilitarization of OM&S assets. According to DoD Manual 4160.28, demilitarization eliminates the functional capabilities and inherent military design features from DoD material to prevent them from being used against the United States. As of September 30, 2016, there was a 471,767-ton stockpile of OM&S assets awaiting demilitarization.\n",
      " \n",
      "Finding\n",
      "We determined that the Army properly reused OM&S assets, safeguarded assets in the demilitarization stockpile, and appropriately disposed of the assets when no longer needed. In addition, although the cost to demilitarize assets exceeded the storage cost, the Army appropriately prioritized the demilitarization workload to focus on safety, policy and legal requirements, and maximizing storage capacity for operational assets.\n",
      " \n",
      "However, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) did not report the liability associated with the cost of disposing the demilitarization stockpile on the FY 2016 Army General Fund Financial Statements and related notes. This occurred because Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) personnel had not approved a methodology to ensure that the disposal estimate provided by Joint Munitions Command had sufficient support. As a result, the Army materially misstated the disposal liability on the FY 2016 Army General Fund Financial Statements and did not provide decision makers adequate information on the funding needed to properly dispose of the demilitarization stockpile.\n",
      " \n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller) develop procedures to annually determine a reasonable estimate for the cost to dispose of the demilitarization stockpile and report the associated liability on the Army General Fund Balance Sheet and related notes.\n",

Specifically, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Operations) agreed to work with Army Materiel Command and Joint Munitions Command to review the current disposal estimation methodology, make improvements as needed, and disclose a supported estimate in the year end FY 2018 financial statements and related notes. \n",
      "Therefore, this recommendation is resolved, but will remain open. We will close the recommendation once we verify that the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Operations) has taken corrective actions to develop procedures to determine demilitarization disposal cost estimates and report the associated liability as required. \n",

      "\n",
      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the DoD had effective controls over chemical surety materials1 in the possession or under the control of the Army and DoD contractors. Specifically, we evaluated accountability and access controls over chemical surety materials at the U.S. Army Pueblo Chemical Depot (Pueblo), U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (Dugway), and a contractor. We also evaluated whether the personnel properly documented the destruction of assembled chemical munitions at Pueblo and U.S. Army Deseret Chemical Depot (Deseret).\n",
      "Findings\n",
      "Army officials properly implemented accountability controls such as inventory management or documenting the destruction of the chemical munition stockpile stored at Pueblo and Deseret; however, Army and contractor personnel did not fully implement accountability controls over chemical surety materials stored at Dugway and a contractor’s facility. Specifically, Dugway and contractor officials did not conduct chemical agent inventories by primary container when one or more primary containers were stored in secondary containers.2 Under the current process in place at these facilities, the primary containers remained sealed within the secondary containers during inventories; therefore, custodians cannot identify and account for leaks, evaporation, or theft that may have occurred. Furthermore, Dugway officials did not immediately notify the chemical materials accountability officer of a 1.5-milliliter shortage of the chemical surety material sarin (GB) identified during an April 19, 2016, inventory nor did they properly document the results of that inventory.\n",
      "In addition, the type of secondary containers used to store chemical surety materials varied at Dugway and the contractor’s facility, and each location used different materials to seal secondary containers. Specifically, Dugway used stainless steel cylinders and ammunition cans sealed with tamper-evident seals; and the contractor used re-sealable plastic containers sealed with tape, which provides no assurance that only authorized personnel had access to chemical surety materials. The Commander, Dugway Proving Ground, also assigned one individual to serve as the accountable officer and primary agent custodian. Although we did not identify instances of fraud or theft during the audit, not segregating the accountable officer and primary agent custodian duties increases the risk of recordkeeping errors and theft.\n",
      "Army and contractor personnel did not fully implement Army accountability controls because Dugway and the contractor standard operating procedures contradict the Army Regulation (AR) 50-6, “Chemical Surety,” July 28, 2008, requirement to conduct inventory by primary container. Although the proponents of DoD Instruction 5210.65, “Security Standards for Safeguarding Chemical Agents,” January 19, 2016, stated that they agreed with the practice of conducting inventories by sealed, secondary containers, they had not documented that in the Instruction. Army Inspector General personnel stated that they conducted chemical surety inspections based on the proponents’ agreed upon practice and not the AR 50-6 requirement. Additionally, DoD Instruction 5210.65 and AR 50-6 do not define minimum specifications for secondary containers and do not provide guidance on the appropriate segregation of duties over the accountability for chemical surety materials. Not fully implementing accountability controls and insufficient oversight and guidance increases the risk that Dugway and the contractor will not properly store and account for chemical surety materials.\n",
      "In addition, personnel at Dugway, the contractor, and Pueblo did not consistently implement their respective chemical personnel reliability program (CPRP) requirements. Specifically, certifying officials did not always report prior drug use to reviewing officials; competent medical authorities did not always provide potentially disqualifying information to certifying officials; CPRP-certified individuals did not always self-report potentially disqualifying information in a timely manner; a certifying official at Pueblo did not properly refer an individual for medical evaluation after an alcohol-related incident; and officials did not always conduct personnel security investigations in a timely manner.\n",
      "CPRP requirements were inconsistently implemented because chemical surety officers did not always provide effective oversight of the program. As a result, there was increased risk that those locations would not meet the purpose of the Army chemical surety program as stated in AR 50-6; which is to ensure that chemical agent operations are conducted in a safe, secure, and reliable manner.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical and Biological Defense revise DoD Instruction 5210.65 to provide clear guidance on appropriate segregation of duties and define acceptable inventory practices.\n",
      "We recommend that the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7, Headquarters Department of the Army coordinate with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical and Biological Defense to provide guidance on appropriate segregation of duties and revise AR 50-6 to align with the revision to DoD Instruction 5210.65 that defines acceptable inventory practices for Army and contractor facilities in possession of chemical surety materials. We also recommend that the U.S. Army Inspector General update chemical surety inspections to align with the revised DoD and Army guidance.\n",
      "We recommend that the Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command, and Commander, Dugway Proving Ground, require chemical material custodians to perform a 100-percent physical inventory of chemical agents, by primary container to establish a baseline of the chemical agent inventory before implementing any alternate inventory procedures; and update standard operating procedures to include any revised inventory requirements.\n",
      "We also recommend that the Commander, Dugway Proving Ground, provide refresher training on reporting and resolving inventory discrepancies and establish adequate segregation of duties over the accountability of chemical surety material inventory.\n",
      "We recommend that the Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command; the Commander, Dugway Proving Ground; and the Commander, Pueblo Chemical Depot, implement additional internal controls to ensure the chemical surety officer provides effective oversight of compliance with Chemical Personnel Reliability Program requirements.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Chemical and Biological Defense partially agreed with the recommendation; he agreed to revise DoD Instruction 5210.65 and did not agree to provide guidance on the appropriate segregation of duties.

      "We determined whether the U.S. Army’s single-award, indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts were properly justified.  In addition, we determined whether associated task and delivery orders were within the scope of the contracts in accordance with Federal and DoD procedures.\n",
      "The Army awarded 43 single-award IDIQ contracts with a value of $29.8 billion from October 1, 2014, through December 31, 2015.  We reviewed a nonstatistical sample of seven single-award IDIQ contracts, valued at $4.1 billion, awarded by two Army Contracting Command (ACC) locations (Aberdeen Proving Ground [APG], Redstone Arsenal [RSA]) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Huntsville) from October 1, 2014, through December 31, 2015.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "Contracting personnel at the ACC-APG, ACC-RSA, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Huntsville) justified the seven contracts we reviewed, valued at $4.1 billion, as single-award IDIQ contracts, and issued 20 task orders consistent with the scope of the associated contracts.  However, an ACC-APG contracting officer did not support one contract (W91CRB-15-D-0022), valued at $192 million, with a required Determination & Findings (D&F) document1 because ACC-APG officials wrongly believed the Justification and Approval (J&A) document,2  which was signed by the senior procurement executive, was sufficient.  The J&A document contained some of the content required for a D&F document, such as the name of the contracting activity, the description of action, and the description of supplies and services.  However, the contracting officer did not cite the specific rationale in the J&A document that was essential to support the D&F exception as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. As a result, ACC-APG contracting officials did not ensure that the D&F document was reviewed, so there is a risk that this contract should not have been awarded to a single source, which eliminates task order competition and could increase contract costs.\n",
      "In addition, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Procurement) (DASA[P]) and ACC-RSA officials did not properly process single-award IDIQ contracts because the Army did not have uniform guidance to prepare, review, and submit D&F documents for single-award IDIQ contracts.  Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "DASA(P) officials could only verify that they submitted two of six D&F documents for the contracts reviewed in a timely manner to the Director, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP).

      "In previous DoD OIG Report No. DODIG-2012-102, we evaluated the effectiveness of the contractor logistics support strategy, involving contractor performance metrics and contract type, for sustainment of the Stryker vehicles.  The DoD OIG determined that officials with the Project Management Office for the Stryker Brigade Combat Team and Army Contracting Command, located in Warren, Michigan, did not implement adequate cost-control procedures on a cost-reimbursable services contract for logistics support of Stryker vehicles awarded to General Dynamic Land Systems. The DoD OIG included recommendations to improve cost-control measures on service contracts for Stryker logistics support.

      "Additionally, DFAS‐Indianapolis personnel continue to prepare unsupported journal vouchers (JVs) to accumulate and report the ODOs’General Fund financial statements. DFAS‐Indianapolis personnel should also improve their process for justifying and reviewing JVs.\n",

      "that they were responsible for including only the JVs manually prepared by DFAS‐Indianapolis and not the system‐generated JVs created by the financial systems.\n",
      " \n",
      "Since DFAS‐Indianapolis cannot properly accumulate and report its financial data for ODOs and the large number and dollar amount of unsupported JVs, it is increasingly probable that the ODOs’General Fund financial statements are materially misstated.

      "The Deputy Chief Financial Officer (DCFO) agreed with our finding and recommendation to develop a universe of ODO General Fund transactions (UoT). However, comments from the DCFO only partially addressed the recommendation; therefore, the recommendation is unresolved and remains open. The DCFO stated that his office is developing a UoT database to capture ODO General Fund transactions. He also stated that the database is able to reconcile to 97 percent of the transaction details to Defense Departmental Reporting System trial balances (unadjusted trial balances). However, DCFO’s comments did not discuss the status of the UoT database that supports the adjustments from the unadjusted trial balance to the adjusted trial balance, and the adjusted trial balance to the financial statements. In addition, the comments did not state what DoD organization is responsible for developing this portion of the UoT database and providing supporting documentation to the auditors. Therefore, we request that the DCFO provide additional comments on the status of the UoT database for these adjustments, and the DoD organization responsible for developing this portion of the database and providing the supporting documentation to the auditors. We also request that the DCFO provide an estimated completion date for this UoT database.\n",

The audit is required by the IPERA, which states that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) must annually review and determine agency compliance with IPERA. The DoD must meet all six of the following requirements to be compliant with IPERA1:\n",
      "\n",
      "publish an annual financial statement for the most recent fiscal year and post that report and any accompanying materials required under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on the agency website;\n",

To fulfill the NDAA requirement, we reviewed the requirements development, the design‐bid-build contract award processes, design suitability, and contractor oversight.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The Fort Bliss Hospital Replacement (FBHR) is an ongoing construction project. The FBHR will include a main hospital, inpatient and outpatient clinics, an administrative building, a research building, a central utility plant, two access control points, and surface parking. The FBHR medical facility will be 1.13 million square feet and include 135 hospital beds, 10 operating rooms, and 30 specialty clinics.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "To fulfill the NDAA requirement we reported on the following five elements. \n",
      "First, we examined the detailed description of the specific design errors and omissions that resulted in the cost increase for the hospital replacement project. As of March 15, 2018, the FBHR project had 978 contract change requests, including 132 cancelled change requests that occurred during construction. The change requests included 453 engineering changes, including design errors and omissions. The FY 2018 budget request for $251.3 million included three line items for design errors and omissions, valued at $165.6 million. The Headquarters United States Army Corps of Engineers (HQUSACE) Medical National Program Manager stated that the requested amount for design errors and omissions of $165.6 million was an estimated amount and that this amount was revised based on negotiations. We identified the modifications awarded as of March 2018, with the negotiated amounts related to the three line items for design errors and omissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design errors and Omissions (through May 2016) [Legacy Issues] for $32.1 million – The USACE Fort Worth District Medical Project Manager stated that design errors and omissions through May 2016 are referred to as legacy issues, which are requests for equitable adjustment made by the construction contractor before May 31, 2016. For example, one design error and omission legacy issue was related to costs and time associated with the Government’s direction that structural steel beams and columns be refabricated to correct errors in the design of the structure and that the contractor cease delivery of steel to the site. This direction impacted the steel erection activities, resulting in reordering work and suspending critical work activities until the refabricated steel was delivered to the site. The cost and time increase for this change was $9.8 million and 65 calendar days. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact Costs (through May 2016) [Time‐Delay Costs] for $142 million − Impact cost is the cost of the overall time delay that the USACE Fort Worth District contracting officer or administrative contracting officer negotiated with the construction contractor. The time delay specifically resulted from changes to the contract related to requests for equitable adjustment before May 31, 2016. One example of a time‐delay cost was the addition of 306 calendar days to the contract, including 126 calendar days due to USACE‐caused delays. The delays related to interior framing issues, seismic test issues, and additional commissioning. Seismic tests ensure the structure being built is earthquake proof. Commissioning is the process of verifying that all building systems perform interactively to the design intent and the systems meet the owner’s operational needs. The cost of the 306 days was $12.7 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Design Errors and Omissions (after May 2016) [Design Validation] for $3.7 million – The USACE Fort Worth District Medical Project Manager stated that Design Errors and Omissions after May 2016 were a result of the design validation. The design validation was a review of the design to identify future cost and schedule impacts that had not been previously identified and which may affect work progress. An example of design errors and omissions during design validation related to the need to correct lighting fixtures and problems with the ceiling. The cost of the lighting and ceiling issues was $1.8 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the full detailed description of the design errors and omissions in the FY 2018 budget request, see the ‘Design Errors and Omissions’ section under Reporting Element 1, in the body of this report. \n",
      "Second, we examined a description of DoDs planned actions to prevent further schedule delays and cost increases on this project as well as lessons learned that could be applied to future projects. We determined that the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment and HQUSACE implemented, or are in the process of implementing, several initiatives, including updating guidance on roles, responsibilities, and management controls. During the FBHR project, the USACE Southwestern Division and Fort Worth District replaced Government management of the FBHR project, conducted a design validation review, and conducted a cost schedule risk analysis. USACE Fort Worth District officials stated that lessons learned would not be determined until an official after action review occurs.\n",
      "Third, we describe any ongoing or completed proceedings or investigations of parties responsible for the delay or cost increase and the status of those proceedings. We determined that as of March 2018, there were no ongoing or completed proceedings or investigations related to the FBHR project.\n",
      "Fourth, we report the results of any final judicial or administration actions taken because of the above proceedings or investigations. As discussed in element 3, as of March 2018, there were no ongoing or completed proceedings or investigations related to the FBHR project.\n",
      "Fifth, we determined that there are areas where improvements are needed for future military construction projects. The recommendations section discusses our recommendations to the key DoD organizations involved in the FBHR project but which should be applied as guidelines for all DoD construction projects, as applicable.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment develop guidance to implement the section 2851, title 10, United States Code reporting requirement for each military construction project that has been specifically authorized by Congress.

      "Specifically, the Commander stated that actions have been taken in accordance with USACE internal management controls and business processes to identify accountability for the actions, which will continue through construction completion. Furthermore, the Commander stated that USACE policies related to engineering and construction quality management and reporting of projects at risk is an established, on‐going process. Additionally, the Commander stated that USACE will conduct an after action report within 180 days of construction completion, which currently is planned for September 2019. Lastly, the Commander stated that USACE will issue interim guidance within 90 days in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 42.15, “Contractor Performance Information,” requirements.\n",
      "The Chief of Staff for the Office of the Surgeon General and U.S. Army Medical Command, responding for the U.S. Army Health Facility Planning Agency Commander, disagreed with the recommendation to review the actions of the individuals involved in the FBHR project to determine whether any actions resulted in the cost and time increase related to design errors and omissions and initiate action to hold them accountable as appropriate. However, the Chief of Staff stated that he would conduct an inquiry to examine military construction (MILCON) processes, management of project sites, and interactions with stakeholders to refine current procedures. He further stated that the inquiry’s finding will be reviewed and implemented on future projects. Additionally, the Chief of Staff stated that the Army Health Facility Planning Agency will assist the Defense Health Agency and USACE, as necessary, with any reviews they may undertake, as a result of this report and its findings. These alternate actions, if implemented, will address the intent of the recommendation.\n",
      "All four recommendations are resolved but remain open. The recommendations will be closed when we obtain evidence to verify that the actions in response to the recommendations have been completed.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) conducted a Service Requirements Review Board (SRRB) to develop, analyze, review, and validate the Trans-Africa Airlift Support Contract (TASC) requirements.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "USAFRICOM and its subordinate command, U.S. Special Operations Command–Africa (SOCAFRICA), require air transportation services to conduct airlift, cargo drops, and emergency evacuation services in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility (AOR). USAFRICOM and SOCAFRICA have a small footprint in Africa, resulting in low-volume and low-frequency movements. \n",
      "On October 26, 2015, SOCAFRICA requested U.S. Transportation Command’s (USTRANSCOM) support to develop and execute an indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) acquisition package to consolidate SOCAFRICA’s airlift requirements into a single contract. On January 5, 2016, SOCAFRICA submitted a requirements package to USTRANSCOM for its IDIQ contract services.\n",
      "USTRANSCOM later proposed to develop requirements for the IDIQ contract that would meet both SOCAFRICA’s and USAFRICOM’s airlift requirements to improve efficiencies and reduce costs.\n",
      "On February 2, 2017, USTRANSCOM awarded the TASC, a firm-fixed-price, IDIQ contract, to AAR Airlift, Berry Aviation, Inc., and Erickson Helicopters to provide airlift services as required by USAFRICOM to support various efforts within the USAFRICOM AOR. The contract requires the contractors to be prepared to perform flight support for training and tactical operations, among other requirements. The contract has a period of performance of 12 months, with four option years and a maximum contract value of $900 million.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "We determined that USAFRICOM, the requiring activity, did not conduct an SRRB to develop, analyze, review, and validate the TASC requirements as required by DoD Instruction 5000.74 prior to USTRANSCOM awarding the $900 million contract. In addition, USTRANSCOM, the decision authority, did not ensure that USAFRICOM completed an SRRB as required by DoD Instruction 5000.74. \n",
      "This occurred because USAFRICOM personnel did not take responsibility as the requiring activity for the TASC. In addition, USTRANSCOM officials assumed that, as long as it received funding and a PWS, the requiring activity had validated the requirements.\n",
      "As a result, the requirements developed for the TASC may not be accurate. Specifically, the PWS for the TASC included requirements for intelligence that were not clear and some medical services that may unnecessarily increase costs. In addition, requirements outlined in the PWS allow the contractor to refuse any mission for safety reasons, which could delay the recovery and return of U.S. Military, DoD civilians, and DoD contractor personnel who are isolated or missing in an uncertain or hostile environment. However, there is no evidence that USAFRICOM conducted an SRRB to document its decision on whether to use contractor or military support for airlift services.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, U.S. Africa Command:\n",
      "\n",
      "develop and implement a training program for personnel supporting the acquisition of services to ensure that requirements are reviewed, validated, and approved prior to awarding contracts; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "conduct a Services Requirement Review Board for the Trans-Africa Airlift Support Contract and coordinate with U.S. Transportation Command to modify the contract accordingly, or conduct an SRRB for each task order awarded under the Trans-Africa Airlift Support Contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also recommend that the Commander, U.S. Transportation Command, develop formal policies and procedures for planning and executing service acquisitions for external requiring activities. \n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Chief of Staff, USTRANSCOM, responding for the Commander, USTRANSCOM, agreed with our recommendations and stated that the USTRANSCOM Acquisition Directorate’s Policy Division is developing formal procedures for planning and executing service acquisitions with an estimated completion date of October 1, 2018.\n",
      "Management Comments Required:\n",
      "The U.S. Africa Command did not respond to our request for comments on the draft of the report, including the recommendations addressed to U.S. Africa Command.

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the Treasury Index (TI) 97 Cash Management report (CMR) was complete, accurate, and supported by the details necessary to perform Fund Balance With Treasury (FBWT) reconciliations.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)-Indianapolis developed the CMR to help Other Defense Organizations (ODOs) reconcile their FBWT accounts because the Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) does not record individual ODO FBWT account balances. The CMR is similar to a commercial bank statement in that it provides a summary cash position for each ODO FBWT account by fiscal year and appropriation at the limit level. Limits are four-character codes that help identify, manage, and report the financial activity of each ODO. DFAS and the ODOs use the CMR to perform individual ODO FBWT account balance reconciliations by the four-character limit. DFAS Manual 7097.01 lists all the valid limits for ODOs.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "We determined that the September 2016 TI-97 CMR was not complete, accurate, or supported by the details necessary for ODOs to perform FBWT reconciliations. \n",
      "Specifically: \n",
      "\n",
      "DFAS-Indianapolis personnel excluded 69 TI-97 appropriations form the CMR that were reported in the Treasury Central Accounting and Reporting System (CARS). Additionally, DFAS-Indianapolis personnel did not report $3.6 billion in financial activity for the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF) on the CMR. This occurred because DFAS-Indianapolis personnel did not design the CMR to report all financial activity for each of the ODOs, as required by the DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR). In addition, the DFAS-Indianapolis standard operating procedures (SOPs) did not require a reconciliation of all TI-97 FBWT accounts in the CMR with all TI-97 FBWT accounts in CARS. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DFAS-Indianapolis personnel made unsupported adjustments of $322.6 million to TI-97 FBWT accounts to resolve differences identified while reconciling the CMR with FBWT account balances in CARS. This occurred because DFAS-Indianapolis did not have SOPs that included detailed steps to identify and resolve the root cause of the differences identified when reconciling the CMR with account balances in CARS in accordance with the DoD FMR. In addition, DFAS-Indianapolis personnel did not maintain supporting documentation for all adjustments made to TI-97 accounts while reconciling the CMR with CARS. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DFAS-Indianapolis personnel reported an absolute amount of $11 billion in unidentified limits on the CMR; therefore, the ODOs did not have the details needed to perform FBWT reconciliations. This occurred because DoD personnel did not record and submit account balances and transactions in DoD accounting and disbursing systems with limits required by DFAS Manual 7097.01. In addition, DFAS-Indianapolis did not design the Headquarters Accounting and Reporting System to convert all unidentified limits into limit “*999” as required by the DoD FMR.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, DFAS-Indianapolis and the ODOs lacked the information needed to perform complete FBWT account reconciliations for September 2016. In addition, the $322.6 million in unsupported adjustments to resolve differences and the use of $11 billion in unidentified limits indicate that the accounting records did not reflect an accurate and supported financial position for the ODO FBWT accounts. This will cause FBWT accounts to be misstated on the individual ODO financial statements and the DoD Agency-wide financial statements. Additionally, without accurate financial data, ODOs management will not be able to make informed budged decisions regarding operations. \n",
      "Recommendations, Management Comments, and Our Response:\n",
      "The Deputy Chief Financial Officer (DCFO) disagreed with the recommendation to create individual DWCF accounts for the Defense Information Systems Agency, Defense Logistics Agency, and DFAAS. Additionally, the DCFO disagreed with the recommendation to establish FBWT accounts or four-digit limits for ODOs in CARS. The comments from the DCFO did not address the specifics of the recommendations; therefore, the recommendations are unresolved. The DCFO stated that splitting up the DWCF will remove valuable flexibility in managing cash balances and may put the ODOs at greater risk of experiencing cash shortages. Additionally, the DCFO state that establishing individual FBWT accounts for ODOs may expose sensitive activities and create an unnecessary burden that would remove much of the flexibility within Defense-wide appropriations. \n",
      "We request that the DCFO reconsider his position on these recommendations and provide additional comments in response to the final report. Specifically the current cash management philosophy prioritizes flexibility within the ODOs’ FBWT accounts rather than accountability. Each agency should establish its own DWCF account and be responsible for managing its individual cash position. Establishing separate accounts will allow for ODOs and the DoD to accurately account for and manage TI-97 FBWT accounts through accountability and direct oversight. The current cash management process adds unnecessary complexities and makes it difficult for DoD personnel to provide reliable and clear audit trail. \n",
      "The DCFO agreed to develop a single, consolidated TI-97 FBWT reconciliation tool; issue policy establishing a list of approved limits; develop a plan to reduce the number and dollar amount of unidentified limits; establish metrics that report the number and amount of unidentified limits by system monthly; and develop a FBWT reconciliation process that incorporates the entire universe of transactions. The comments from the DCFO either partially addressed the recommendations or did not address all of the specifics of the recommendations. Therefore, the recommendations are unresolved. We request that the DCFO provide additional comments in response to the final report. \n",
      "The DCFO agreed to require DoD disbursing stations to report transaction level data to the Treasury on a daily basis. The DCFO addressed all specifics of the recommendation; therefore, the recommendation is resolved but will remain open. \n",
      "We provided the draft report to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller) and requested comments to the draft report and the recommendation to correct the Navy’s financial systems to report TI-97 transactions with the limits approved by the DCFO. However; the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller) did not respond to the draft report or the recommendation. Therefore, the recommendation is unresolved. \n",
      "We request that the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller) provide comments on the final report.\n",
      "The Director, DFAS-Indianapolis, disagreed with the recommendation to produce a consolidated CMR that supports TI-97 FBWT account reconciliations; to document the updated CMR process in process maps and process narratives; to revise existing SOPs to require reconciliation of all TI-97 FBWT accounts to CARS; and to require DFAS personnel to obtain written approval for any adjustment made to TI-97 accounts. The comments from the Director did not address the specifics of the recommendations; therefore, the recommendations are unresolved. The Director stated that the DoD OIG audit team narrowly focused on the CMR, which is only a portion of the comprehensive FBWT reconciliation process. The Director disagreed with the DoD OIG interpretation that the DoD FMR requires the CMR to be the exclusive FBWT reconciliation tool. Lastly, the Director stated that identifying differences at an absolute value misstates the impact to an entity’s cash position.\n",
      "We request that the Director reconsider his position on these recommendations and provide additional comments in response to the final report. We acknowledge that the DoD FMR does not require a single FBWT reconciliation tool. However, the DoD FMR requires DFAS and the Components to reconcile the Government-Wide Accounting statement in CARS with the CMR. DFAS and the Components could not demonstrate that they could reconcile the Government-Wide Accounting statement to the CMR without unsupported summary level variances. Lastly, each transaction should be scrutinized in terms of absolute value, regardless of the transaction’s net impact.\n",
      "The Director, DFAS-Indianapolis, agreed to develop SOPs that provide steps on identifying differences between TI-97 FBWT accounts in the CMR and in CARS and to require DFAS-Indianapolis to maintain supporting documentation for any adjustment made to TI-97 FBWT accounts. The comments from the Director partially addressed the recommendations; therefore, the recommendations are unresolved. We request that the Director provide additional comments in response to the final report that detail his plan for developing SOPs that provide steps on identifying and resolving differences between the CMR and in CARS; and requiring DFAS-Indianapolis personnel to maintain supporting documentation for any adjustment made to TI-97 FBWT accounts.\n",
      "The Director, DFAS-Indianapolis, agreed to produce a CMR that reports only TI-97 activity and to report the absolute dollar amount of the balances recorded in unidentified limits to the ODOs monthly. The comments from the Director addressed all specifics of the recommendations, and no further comments are required. Therefore, the recommendations are resolved but will remain open.\n",

      "\n",
      "Objective \n",
      "This audit was conducted in response to a hotline complaint. We determined whether the Troops‑to‑Teachers (TTT) program properly paid participants, withheld and reported taxes, collected payments from those that failed to meet program requirements, and managed the grant program that provides funding to support the TTT program.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "The TTT program provides assistance to eligible military participants interested in becoming teachers.1  The program provides counseling and referral services for participants to help them meet education and licensing requirements to teach and subsequently helps them secure teaching positions. In addition, the program provides financial assistance in the form of stipend payments paid to offset the cost of obtaining a teaching certification, as well as bonuses for participants who teach in an eligible or high need school.2  In 2015, the TTT program paid 1,374 participants $3.7 million in stipends and bonuses. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness, through the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) (OUSD [P&R]), is responsible for providing policy and funding for the TTT program. The DoD a ssigned the daily operations of the TTT program to the Defense Activity for Non‑Traditional Education Support (DANTES), an activity within the Naval Education and Training Command (NETC). DANTES personnel also manage a grant program that provided $4.4 million in 2015 to states to support recruiting efforts aimed at prospective participants.\n",
      "Finding \n",
      "The OUSD (P&R), DANTES, and Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS) did not manage the TTT program adequately. We nonstatistically sampled 63 stipends and bonuses paid by DANTES personnel, valued at $212,000, and found that 25 payments, valued at $87,000, were improperly paid. These payments were improper because DANTES personnel either incorrectly approved participants who did not meet program eligibility requirements or failed to obtain sufficient documentation to determine whether participants met those requirements. Specifically, DANTES improperly paid 14 stipends valued at $45,000 and 11 bonuses valued at $42,000. This occurred because OUSD (P&R) did not develop policy to implement 10 U.S.C. §1154 (2015) (TTT Program Law). In addition, DANTES management operated the program on draft standard operating procedures that were not fully in accordance with the TTT program law and that had not been subject to a legal review. Furthermore, DANTES management did not provide training to personnel on the requirements and procedures for determining applicant eligibility for the TTT program. As a result, there is no assurance that participants were eligible to receive the stipends and bonuses awarded by DANTES personnel.\n",
      "In addition, DANTES and DFAS personnel reported the TTT stipend and bonus payments as wages to the participants on their Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Forms W-2s but did not withhold Federal income tax from the payments as required by Internal Revenue Code, U.S.C. Title 26. This occurred because DANTES and DFAS systems were not configured with the capability to withhold taxes. In addition, DANTES and DFAS management did not have a memorandum of agreement (MOA) that assigned the organizational roles and responsibilities for implementing Federal income tax withholding requirements. As a result, DFAS may owe penalties for the taxes it failed to withhold.\n",
      "DANTES personnel also did not establish a debt collection process with DFAS for participants who did not fulfill program requirements. This occurred because there was no mutual understanding or communication between DANTES management and DFAS of their roles and responsibilities for collecting debt. As a result, $381,000 for stipends and bonuses paid to participants who failed to fulfill program requirements remains uncollected.\n",
      "Finally, DANTES management did not establish the TTT grant program in accordance with DoD grant regulations and compare the states’ expenditures and results to the states’ desired goals and objectives. This occurred because DANTES management did not follow laws and regulations when they established the grant program and the OUSD (P&R) did not develop policy to implement, manage, and oversee the TTT grant program. As a result, it is unclear whether the TTT grant program achieved the desired results in assisting transitioning service members with meeting the requirements necessary to become teachers.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Readiness develop and implement policies to clearly define the TTT program requirements, to include the implementation, management, and oversight of the TTT grant program.\n",
      "In addition, we recommend that the Commander, Naval Education and Training Command direct TTT management to:\n",
      "\n",
      "develop procedures that align with newly developed policy and provide training for all government and contract employees within the TTT program after new policy and procedures are created;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "review standard operating procedures in coordination with management officials and the Office of General Counsel to ensure they are in accordance with TTT program law requirements to determine participant eligibility while new policy is being developed;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "continue to work with DFAS to finalize corrective actions to withhold Federal income taxes on payments, and develop roles and responsibilities for tax withholding and debt collections;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "review all applications for stipends and bonuses submitted between October 1, 2014, and the date of this report, and bring into compliance applications determined to be incomplete and collect payments from participants determined to be ineligible; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "maintain a database of current addresses for participants;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "submit debt collection packages to DFAS for outstanding debt; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "complete corrective action plans in process for collections and the grant program.\n",
      "\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "An official, performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, agreed to establish an instruction within 24 months that will assign responsibilities and prescribe procedures for determining participant eligibility, and implement, manage, and oversee grants for the TTT program in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 1154 (2015). Therefore, the recommendations are resolved but will remain open. We will close the recommendations once we verify that the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness, Force Education and Training, has developed and implemented program policy in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 1154 (2015).\n",
      "The Commander, NETC, agreed with aligning procedures with OUSD policy once that policy is developed. Furthermore, DANTES is actively engaged with the Office of General Counsel to have TTT standard operating procedures reviewed to ensure compliance with the TTT legislation. DANTES has also trained TTT personnel on processes and procedures that have been reviewed and determined to comply with 10 U.S.C § 1154 (2015). Therefore, these recommendations are resolved but will remain open. We will close the recommendations once we verify that the OUSD developed program policy and TTT procedures align with the policy; the NETC Office of General Counsel has reviewed TTT procedures; the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Readiness, Force Education and Training has reviewed the procedures; and we reviewed the new contract and verify that personnel have been trained.\n",
      "The Commander, NETC, while agreeing in principle with the recommendation to correct the tax withholding problem, stated that DANTES cannot ensure DFAS will complete the system changes needed. DANTES implemented a systems change effective March 2017 in its current Financial Management System delineating the tax portion required to be paid to the IRS. The Director, Finance Standards and Customer Services, DFAS, also provided comments on the recommendation to correct system deficiencies for tax withholding. The Director stated that DFAS completed the required system changes and that tax withholding has been implemented for the TTT payments. Additionally, DFAS validated that the tax withholding capability is available in the Defense Agency’s Initiative system to support the program migration to the Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) in October 2017. Therefore, this recommendation is resolved but will remain open. We will close the recommendation once we verify that tax withholding is automated and occurring in the Automated Disbursing System for current payments and the Defense Agencies Initiative System for payments made after October 1, 2017.\n",
      "The Commander, NETC, stated that DANTES conducted a review of TTT participant records to substantiate participant eligibility for stipend and bonuses. He also recommended that DFAS send the required IRS tax forms to participants at the end of the year. He further stated that an MOA was established between DANTES and DFAS and that DANTES is working with the DHRA to determine whether updates need to be made to the current MOA. He stated that DANTES maintained a database of addresses for participants to allow them to review and update their records as required. Furthermore, debt collection packages have been submitted to DFAS for collections. In addition, DANTES formally established the TTT grant program, and grants have been awarded to participating State Departments of Education. Therefore, these recommendations are resolved but will remain open. We will close these recommendations once we verify that the DFAS tax office sent the required IRS forms to participants at the end of the calendar year along with the W‑2’s; the database is maintaining participant’s current addresses; the debt collection packages have been submitted to DFAS, and the TTT grant program has been established and grants have been awarded to participating State Departments of Education.\n",

      "We determined whether the DoD appropriately paid for one-on-one applied behavior analysis interventions (ABA services) for the treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the TRICARE North Region. The audit was requested by the Director, TRICARE Health Plan. The TRICARE North Region contractor paid 1,388,073 claim line items for ABA services, valued at $120.1 million, in 2015 and 2016.1\n",

      "TRICARE is the DoD’s managed health care program for active duty service members, retirees, and eligible family members. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) manages the TRICARE program. For eligible beneficiaries diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, TRICARE provides reimbursement for covered ABA services. According to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, “ABA is a well-developed scientific discipline among the helping professions that focuses on the analysis, design, implementation, and evaluation of social and other environmental modifications to produce meaningful changes in human behavior.” To receive payment, ABA companies submit claims to the TRICARE North Region managed care support contractor. Generally, health care companies (including ABA companies) are not required to submit patient medical records, such as ABA session notes, as\n",
      "\n",
      "supporting documentation when submitting claims. However, DHA contractor personnel may request a medical record from an ABA company to verify that services were performed appropriately. Failure to adequately document medical care will result in complete or partial denial of the claim.\n",

      "\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The DHA made improper payments for ABA services to companies in the TRICARE North Region. We statistically project that the DHA, through its contractor, improperly paid $81.2 million of the total $120.1 million paid to ABA companies in the TRICARE North Region for ABA services performed in 2015 and 2016. The DHA either lacked documentation or had insufficient documentation to support the payment to the ABA companies. The DHA did not detect these improper payments because the DHA did not perform comprehensive medical reviews on a statistically representative sample of ABA claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In a prior audit report (DoDIG-2017-064), we identified that the DHA made improper payments for ABA services to five ABA companies within the same geographic area in the TRICARE South Region that generally billed at the highest possible rate. As a result, we projected that the DHA improperly paid $1.9 million of the total $3.1 million paid to the five companies for ABA services performed in 2015. We recommended that the Director, DHA, conduct comprehensive medical reviews of ABA companies in the TRICARE South Region that show indicators of improper payments, including, but not limited to, companies billing 6 or more hours a day for children 4 years of age or younger, and compare medical records to ABA company claims to determine whether the charges were appropriate.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "During our audit of the TRICARE North Region, we identified systemic improper payments that included not only high-risk ABA companies, but ABA companies with low risk profiles as well. Because we identified significant improper payments across the TRICARE North Region, it is probable that the TRICARE South and West Regions also have ABA companies that are not properly documenting covered ABA services provided to TRICARE beneficiaries.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether the DoD paid reasonable prices for standard electric breast pumps and replacement parts provided to beneficiaries in the TRICARE North, South, and West Regions in 2016.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "The Defense Health Agency (DHA), an agency under the control, authority, and direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), manages the TRICARE program. TRICARE is the DoD’s managed health care program for active duty service members, retirees, and eligible family members both in the United States and overseas. In the United States, the TRICARE program is divided into the North, South, and West health service regions (referred to in our report as the three TRICARE regions). The DHA awarded contracts to three contractors to manage health care support and claims processing for the three TRICARE regions. \n",
      "To determine whether the DHA overpaid for breast pumps, we compared the amounts the DHA paid to the fixed reimbursement rate. We used this reimbursement rate because the contractor in the TRICARE West region negotiated with three national suppliers to obtain fixed reimbursement rates for eight different breast pump models. Furthermore, the TRICARE North and South regions may have been able to obtain similar rates because two of these three national suppliers also provided breast pumps to beneficiaries in the TRICARE North and South regions in 2016.\n",
      "In addition, to determine whether the DHA overpaid for replacement parts, we compared the amounts the DHA paid to reimbursement rates paid by Medicaid, which is funded jointly by states and the U.S. Government. We used the highest Medicaid rates across six states. According to DHA personnel, none of the three TRICARE regional contractors negotiated fixed reimbursement rates with suppliers for replacement parts.\n",
      "Finding:\n",
      "We concluded that the DHA overpaid for standard electric breast pumps and replacement parts for beneficiaries in the three TRICARE regions in 2016. Specifically, the DHA overpaid for:\n",
      "\n",
      "54,006 of 59,241 breast pumps (91.2 percent); and\n",
      "380,911 of 671,112 replacement parts (56.8 percent).\n",
      "\n",
      "This occurred because the DHA did not require contractors for the three TRICARE regions to use only suppliers that had fixed reimbursement rates for breast pumps and replacement parts. As a result, we calculated that the DHA overpaid $16.2 million for standard electric breast pumps and replacement parts provided to TRICARE beneficiaries in all three TRICARE regions in 2016. If the DHA continues its current practice, and prices and volume stay the same, the DHA could overpay an additional $81.2 million over the next 5 years.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the DHA Director:\n",
      "\n",
      "Use only suppliers that have entered into agreements that have fixed reimbursement rates to provide standard electric breast pumps and replacement parts throughout all TRICARE regions. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To the extent practicable, review and pursue appropriate action, such as recouping any overpayments from the suppliers that billed excessive amounts for breast pumps and replacement parts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "The DHA Director agreed with our finding, but only partially agreed with our recommendation to negotiate fixed rates for breast pumps and parts. The DHA Director stated that the implementation of a fixed rate for breast pumps and parts is a necessary step and the DHA is in the preliminary phases of establishing these maximum allowable rates. The DHA Director also stated that DHA contractors could then apply additional discounts for their network providers. The DHA Director stated that the DHA wants to allow beneficiaries to continue to have access to out‑of‑network providers and retail environments for the purchases of these items with reasonable cost controls. Therefore, the recommendation is resolved but remains open. We will close the recommendation once we verify that the DHA has established maximum allowable rates for breast pumps and replacement parts that prevent suppliers from overbilling the DoD.\n",
      "The DHA Director agreed with our recommendation to review and pursue appropriate action, such as recouping any overpayments from suppliers that billed excessive amounts for breast pumps and replacement parts, stating that the TRICARE West Region contractor was successful in recouping $718,559.20 to date from one supplier. Therefore, the recommendation is resolved but remains open. We will close the recommendation once we verify that the DHA took appropriate action, such as recouping any overpayments from other suppliers that billed excessive amounts for breast pumps and replacement parts.\n",

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) and Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) contracting officials provided small businesses adequate opportunity to be awarded prime contracts. In addition, we determined what actions Air Force contracting officials at these locations took to ensure prime contractors met their small business subcontracting goals. We reviewed a nonstatistical sample of 53 contracts, valued at $1.8 billion.\n",
      "Findings\n",
      "AFLCMC and AFNWC contracting officials provided small businesses with adequate opportunities to compete for all 30 prime contracts, valued at $26.9 million, awarded in FY 2015. Specifically, AFLCMC and AFNWC contracting officials provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "adequate opportunities for small businesses to compete by conducting market research and advertising solicitations for 14 contracts, valued at $14.8 million; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "justifications for sole-source awards for 16 contracts, valued at $12.0 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "AFLCMC and AFNWC contracting officials generally ensured that prime contractors provided small businesses with adequate subcontracting opportunities for 13 contracts, valued at $325.3 million, of 20 contracts, valued at $350.2 million, with estimated completion dates in FY 2014 and FY 2015. However, AFLCMC contracting officials did not ensure prime contractors provided small businesses with adequate subcontracting opportunities for the other seven contracts, valued at $24.9 million. Specifically, AFLCMC contracting officials did not:\n",
      "\n",
      "monitor prime contractors’ compliance with individual subcontracting plans for four contracts, valued at $10.9 million; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "determine why prime contractors with individual subcontracting plans did not meet their small business subcontracting goals for three contracts, valued at $14.0 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "AFLCMC contracting officials stated that this occurred because administering subcontracting plans was not a high priority. In addition, AFLCMC contracting management did not provide training to contracting officers on requirements for administering subcontracting plans or adequate guidance or training for completing the “Subcontract Plan” field in the Federal Procurement Data System–Next Generation (FPDS‑NG) (a Government-wide, web-based system for collecting, developing and disseminating procurement data). Completing the Subcontract Plan field properly enables the contracting officer to monitor compliance with small business subcontracting plans when a plan is required.\n",
      "As a result, small businesses may have been denied subcontracting opportunities that large businesses were required to make a good-faith effort to provide. In addition, AFLCMC contracting officials did not determine whether prime contractors made a good-faith effort to comply with negotiated subcontracting goals and whether up to $2.8 million in liquidated damages should be assessed.\n",
      "In addition, we reviewed three high-dollar value contracts, valued at $1.5 billion, awarded to other than small businesses during FY 2015. We found that those three contracts had approved subcontracting plans.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Chief, Product Support Contracting Division, AFLCMC, correct the FPDS‑NG and require the contractors to submit individual subcontracting reports in the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (a Government-wide, web-based system for small business subcontracting program reporting) for the three specified contracts. If the individual subcontracting reports show the contractors did not meet the contract’s subcontracting goals, determine whether the contractor made a good-faith effort to meet its subcontracting goals, and if not, assess liquidated damages against the contractor. In addition, we recommend that the Chief determine whether the contractors for the three specified contracts made a good-faith effort to meet the small business subcontracting goals in their subcontracting plans, and if not, assess liquidated damages against the contractor.\n",
      "We recommend that the Director, Contracting Directorate, Air Force Sustainment Center, Hill Operating Location, direct his staff to train AFLCMC and AFNWC, contracting officials on their Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 19.7 responsibilities for administering subcontracting plans, and update their FPDS-NG training to include how to complete the “Subcontract Plan” field.\n",
      "Management Actions Taken\n",
      "During the audit, we informed the Chief, Product Support Contracting Division, AFLCMC, that AFLCMC needed to obtain individual subcontracting reports in the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System for the three specified contracts and then determine whether the contractors made a good-faith effort to meet their subcontracting goals. We also informed the Chief that AFLCMC needed to determine whether the contractors made a good-faith effort to meet their subcontracting goals for three other specified contracts whose individual subcontracting reports indicated that the contractors had not met their subcontracting goals.\n",
      "The Chief a greed with our observations. We verified that AFLCMC contracting officials corrected the FPDS‑NG and obtained the missing individual subcontracting reports for the three specified contracts. For all six contracts, AFLCMC contracting officials determined that the contractors either exceeded their subcontracting goals or made a good-faith effort to meet their subcontracting goals.\n",
      "We informed the Director, Contracting Directorate, Air Force Sustainment Center, Hill Operating Location, that his staff needed to train AFLCMC and AFNWC contracting officials on their Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 19.7 responsibilities for administering subcontracting plans, update their FPDS‑NG training to include how to complete the “Subcontract Plan” field, and update their FPDS‑NG guidance to include how to complete the “Subcontract Plan” field.\n",
      "The Director agreed with our observations. We verified that Contracting Directorate, Air Force Sustainment Center, Hill Operating Location personnel provided the necessary training to the AFLCMC and AFNWC contracting officials and updated their FPDS-NG guidance to include instructions on how to complete the “Subcontract Plan” field.\n",
      "AFLCMC and AFNWC management actions taken during the audit addressed the recommendations; therefore, no further comments are required and the recommendations are closed. We provided a discussion draft of this report to AFLCMC and AFNWC on January 19, 2017. Neither AFLCMC nor AFNWC had any substantive comments on the discussion draft. We therefore did not require a written response, and we are publishing this report in final form.\n",

      "(U) Objective:\n",
      "(U) We determined whether DoD Components implemented the DoD Emergency Management (EM) Program in accordance with Federal and DoD policy for installations within the U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) area of responsibility.\n",
      "(U) Background:\n",
      "(U) DoD Instruction 6055.17 defines EM as an ongoing process to prevent, mitigate, prepare for, respond to, maintain continuity during, and recover from an incident that threatens life, property, operations, or the environment. EM focuses on emergencies affecting installation personnel and facilities, and the ability of the installation to act as a force projection platform. According to the Instruction, the DoD should maintain readiness and sustain mission assurance by establishing a comprehensive, all-hazards EM program at DoD installations worldwide. The DoD has U.S. personnel, operations, or equipment at locations within the USAFRICOM area of responsibility.\n",
      "(U) Findings:\n",
      "DoD Components did not fully implement the DoD EM Program in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility. Specifically, we determined that USAFRICOM, the Military Departments, and Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa EM officials did not develop EM programs for locations in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility. According to USAFRICOM, Military Departments, and Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa EM officials, only locations in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility had EM programs. In addition, the Department of the Navy and Air Force EM officials did not implement all DoD EM Program requirements outlined in DoD Instruction 6055.17 for the two locations with programs that we visited. For example, the Installation Commander, did not ensure they had the resources and equipment necessary to meet requirements, and the Installation Commander, did not complete a capability risk assessment.\n",
      "(U) The DoD EM Program was not fully implemented in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility because:\n",
      "·        (U) the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics(USD[AT&L]) did not provide guidance on how DoD Components should determine the level of DoD EM Program necessary for each installation, including installations with a small footprint like those found in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility; and\n",
      "·        (U) USAFRICOM did not oversee the DoD EM Program for its area of responsibility.\n",
      "(U) Without an EM program, DoD installations in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility do not have a formal and coordinated effort to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from an attack or natural emergency, which could ultimately threaten the lives of personnel and property on DoD installations and impede the DoD’s ability to successfully complete mission operations.\n",

      "(U) Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations, and Environment), responding for the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Environment, Safety, and Occupation Health), partially agreed with the recommendation to update DoD Instruction 6055.17 to require DoD Components to complete risk assessments at all locations worldwide to determine whether locations require an EM program and to include instructions for determining which DoD Components are responsible for completing the risk assessments. In addition, the Assistant Secretary partially agreed with the recommendation to issue interim guidance that requires DoD Components to evaluate all locations worldwide to determine the need for an EM program. The Assistant Secretary only partially addressed the recommendations; therefore, the recommendations are unresolved and open. We request that the Assistant Secretary provide specific actions to address the recommendations after working through the EM Steering Group. In addition, we request that the Assistant Secretary provide planned dates of completion of those actions.\n",

The Assistant Secretary did not address the recommendation; therefore, the recommendation is unresolved and open. We acknowledge the need to avoid redundancy, but according to DoD Instruction 6055.17, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations, and Environment), has oversight responsibilities. According to DoD Instruction 6055.17, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations, and Environment), under the authority, direction, and control of the USD(AT&L), will coordinate DoD EM Program requirements with other guidance and instructions and develop and maintain DoD policy to provide consistent and integrated EM. However, without an assessment process and oversight, there is no assurance that DoD Component heads are applying a consistent and integrated approach for implementing and assessing compliance of EM Programs effectively.\n",

      "The Marine Corps is organized into three active duty combat divisions, three active duty air wings, and multiple other supporting units and serves as the Nation’s forward-deployed expeditionary force. Within the Marine Corps, a Marine Aircraft Wing is composed of one or more Marine Aviation Groups, which in turn are composed of one or more squadrons. For readiness reporting, a squadron reports to a Marine Aircraft Group, which in turn reports to a Marine Aircraft Wing. The Deputy Commandant for Aviation coordinates with the Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policy, and Operations on policy, procedures, and guidance for aviation unit readiness reporting. \n",
      "Marine Corps Aviation squadrons are organized by aircraft type and are expected to execute a list of specified mission essential tasks (METs). As part of the readiness reporting, squadron commanders are required to complete an assessment of the squadron’s core METs. To perform its core METs, a squadron must have a specific number of mission-capable aircraft.\n",
      "The Marine Corps readiness reporting guidance requires that squadron commanders assess their METs based on the squadron’s present state of readiness. In addition, the guidance requires squadron commanders to assess whether the squadron is appropriately equipped to perform its METs. The guidance also requires intermediate commands to establish procedures to verify, within 5 days of submission, the completeness and accuracy of the subordinate readiness reports. Readiness guidance further requires the Marine Corps to maintain a single uniform system for the preparation, approval, and maintenance of readiness reporting and establishes reporting organizations and frequency of readiness reporting. According to the guidance, readiness is reported as needed or on at least a monthly basis.\n",

      "nine squadron commanders did not report the present state of their squadron’s aircraft readiness;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "five squadron commanders did not accurately report the number of mission-capable aircraft in their MET assessment; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "four squadron commanders did not accurately report whether their squadron was properly equipped to perform its METs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This occurred because Marine Corps readiness reporting guidance is unclear and was interpreted differently by the squadron commanders. Specifically, the Marine Corps readiness guidance is unclear on the definition of present state, silent on how squadron commanders should report the number of mission-capable aircraft in their MET assessments, and unclear on how squadron commanders are to report their METs as resourced. In addition, Marine Aircraft Group officials did not provide oversight to ensure that squadron commanders accurately reported squadron aircraft readiness. As a result, Marine Corps officials do not have an accurate assessment of what the aircrafts’ capabilities currently are, which could negatively impact planning for training and operations by assigning a mission to an aircraft that it is not capable of performing. This could potentially put mission accomplishment and personnel at risk.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Deputy Commandant for Aviation, Headquarters, Marine Corps require all reporting units and organizations to use the Optimized Organizational Maintenance Activity (OOMA) system as the sole source for reporting aircraft readiness. We also recommend that the Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies, and Operations, in coordination with the Deputy Commandant for Aviation:\n",
      "\n",
      "revise Marine Corps Order 3000.13A to include a clear definition of present state, and clarify how mission-capable aircraft quantities should be reported in the mission essential task assessments and how a mission essential task should be properly reported as resourced;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "implement training on reporting readiness, in accordance with the revised Marine Corps Order 3000.13A, for reporting units and organizations; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "develop and implement procedures, in accordance with the revised Marine Corps Order 3000.13A, to ensure that intermediate commands verify the completeness and accuracy of their subordinate units’ readiness reports. \n",
      "\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Deputy Commandant for Aviation, Headquarters, Marine Corps, agreed to require that all reporting units use OOMA as the sole source for reporting aircraft readiness, but stated that OOMA, used in combination with the Marine Aviation Commanders Combat Readiness Assessment Tool, would provide a more accurate assessment of aircraft readiness than OOMA alone. However, the Deputy Commandant did not provide specifics of how the two systems would provide a more accurate readiness assessment and whether their use would be required. Therefore, we consider the recommendation unresolved and request additional comments to the final report. The Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies, and Operations agreed to coordinate with the Deputy Commandant for Aviation to revise the Marine Corps Order 3000.13A to define present state, clarify how mission-capable aircraft quantities should be reported, and how a mission essential task should be properly reported as resourced. The Deputy Commandant also agreed to implement training in accordance with the Marine Corps Order 3000.13A revision. Therefore, the recommendations are resolved and will be closed once we verify that the planned actions are fully implemented. \n",
      "Although the Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies, and Operations agreed to coordinate with the Deputy Commandant for Aviation to develop procedures that ensure intermediate commands verify the completeness and accuracy of subordinate units’ readiness reports, he did not specify how the verification will be achieved. Therefore, we consider the recommendation unresolved and request additional comments to the final report.\n",

      "\n",
      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) performed triannual reviews (TARs) of certain financial transactions in accordance with applicable regulations. Specifically, we determined whether the TARs performed provided reasonable assurance that unliquidated obligations, accounts payable, unfilled customer orders, and accounts receivable transactions were valid, accurate, and complete.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "We focused on May 31, 2016, and September 30, 2016, for our review. USTRANSCOM did not perform TARs during this period in accordance with the DoD Financial Management Regulation. This occurred because Program Analysis and Financial Management Directorate personnel did not develop required processes and procedures to complete TARs. In addition, USTRANSCOM personnel stated that Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness workload priorities precluded completion of TAR reporting efforts under DoD Financial Management Regulation guidelines. Instead, Directorate personnel limited their review to actions on a manually created open document list (ODL) that did not contain all open obligations as required by the DoD Financial Management Regulation. As a result, USTRANSCOM was unable to determine that unliquidated obligations of $1.8 billion, accounts payable balances of $0.7 billion, accounts receivable balances of $1.3 billion, and unfilled customer orders were valid, accurate, and complete.\n",
      "Furthermore, because USTRANSCOM was unable to provide sufficient supporting documentation we were unable to obtain reasonable assurance that those balances were properly reported. Because TARs were not completed as required, USTRANSCOM and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer, DoD may not have had reliable financial information to make informed decisions.\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Director, Program Analysis and Financial Management Directorate, USTRANSCOM, develop and implement procedures to execute triannual reviews in accordance with DoD Financial Management Regulation requirements. The processes and procedures should ensure that each commitment, obligation, accounts payable, unfilled customer order, and accounts receivable is properly recorded, and reports are prepared for submission in the DoD standard format. Moreover, the processes and procedures should identify staff positions responsible for executing proper TARs.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Deputy Commander, USTRANSCOM, agreed with our finding and recommendations. The Deputy Commander agreed to coordinate with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Air Force to develop, document, and implement processes and procedures to execute triannual reviews in accordance with Office of Secretary of Defense guidance, including identifying responsible personnel. Additionally, the Deputy Commander agreed to ensure reports are correctly and accurately prepared based on Office of Secretary of Defense guidance. We consider the Deputy Commanders comments responsive to our recommendations; therefore, the recommendation is resolved but remains open.\n",
      "We will close this recommendation once we verify that USTRANSCOM has developed, documented, and implemented processes and procedures for properly executing the triannual review that include identifying responsible personnel, coordination with the Office of Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Air Force, and detailed instructions to ensure reports are correctly prepared based on Office of Secretary of Defense guidance. The Deputy Commander, USTRANSCOM, estimated that the recommendation would be implemented by September 30, 2017.\n",

      "Sept. 21, 2017  —\n",
      "\n",
      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) effectively managed Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) transactions for logistics support, supplies, and services.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "ACSAs are bilateral agreements between the United States and authorized foreign entities for the exchange of logistics support, supplies, and services. ACSAs allow logistical exchanges between the United States and the military forces of eligible countries and international organizations. The ACSA program gives the commander increased flexibility in addressing logistical requirements. Implementing arrangements are supplementary agreements that prescribe details, terms, and conditions to effectively implement cross-servicing agreements. While these arrangements normally are more detailed than the ACSAs, they must be completely consistent with the ACSAs they support. An implementing arrangement is a type of international agreement under DoD Directive 5530.3, “International Agreements,” June 11, 1987.\n",
      "Federal law grants the Secretary of Defense the authority to use ACSAs. Within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD[AT&L]) is the focal point for the ACSA program. DoD Directive 2010.9, “Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements,” November 24, 2003, establishes ACSA policy and assigns responsibilities for the OUSD(AT&L), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), the Military Departments, Defense agencies and combatant commands and for the implementation of the ACSA program.\n",
      "As part of the responsibility assigned in DoD Directive 2010.9, the CJCS provides guidance for implementing the ACSA and assigns roles and responsibilities for the Joint Staff, combatant commands, direct reporting units, and Defense agencies reporting to the Secretary of Defense through CJCS Instruction 2120.01D, “Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements,” May 21, 2015. CJCS Instruction 2120.01D directs the use of ACSAs in accordance with Federal law.1 It also requires the use of the ACSA Global Automated Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS) to fully document all transfers of logistics support, supplies, and services between U.S. and foreign entities under ACSA authorities and states that the program should be executed by designated ACSA officials at the lowest organizational level.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "USAFRICOM did not effectively manage the ACSA orders it executed and was not required to oversee ACSA orders executed by its Subordinate Components in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility. Specifically, USAFRICOM and its Subordinate Components did not include all minimum essential data elements on ACSA orders and upload source documents supporting line items on ACSA orders into AGATRS. In addition, some Subordinate Components were not maintaining ACSA orders in AGATRS or tracking ACSA orders under ACSA authorities. Specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. Marine Corps Forces Africa did not maintain all transactions in AGATRS,\n",
      "U.S. Naval Forces Africa did not know that ACSA orders were used for medical activities, and\n",
      "U.S. Air Forces Africa did not document that meals were provided under ACSA authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, U.S. Special Operations Command Africa entered into four agreements that met the intent of an implementing arrangement without understanding the requirements for completing and coordinating an implementing arrangement.\n",
      "These conditions occurred, in part, because the OUSD(AT&L) did not monitor compliance with DoD Directive 2010.9 as required or establish training requirements for personnel who execute ACSA orders. In addition, the CJCS provided implementation guidance that does not apply to Military Departments and some Defense agencies and does not establish clear training requirements. Furthermore, neither the Secretary of the Navy nor the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), issued ACSA policy or program guidance, and USAFRICOM did not update its ACSA instruction.\n",
      "As a result, the CJCS, Secretaries of Military Departments, and Commander, USAFRICOM, did not have assurance that logistics support, supplies, and services transactions executed in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility were accurate or reimbursed. For example, we reviewed ACSA orders from January 2014 through December 2016 and identified that the DoD did not have assurance that 196 orders, valued at $32.1 million, for logistics support, supplies, and services were accurate or reimbursed. Furthermore, USAFRICOM’s Subordinate Components may not be capturing the transfer of items or services as logistics support, supplies, and services in support of an ACSA, resulting in inaccurate program records for DoD Components or the Military Services not being reimbursed for logistics support, supplies, and services. Finally, poor implementation of the ACSA program will reduce flexibility for commanders to address logistical shortfalls.\n",
      "Recommendations and Management Actions Taken\n",
      "We recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics:\n",
      "\n",
      "Review the current implementation and execution of the ACSA program and update DoD Directive 2010.9 to define oversight responsibilities for Office of the Secretary of Defense, Military Departments, Defense agencies, Joint Staff and combatant commands; to require use of a DoD system of record to maintain ACSA orders; to define ACSA order and billing officials roles; and to clarify requirements for implementing arrangements.\n",
      "Develop and issue program guidance as required by DoD Directive 2010.9 for the Military Services and Defense agencies.\n",
      "Develop a training program or training program requirements for the implementation of the ACSA program and execution of ACSA authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the discussion draft, the OUSD(AT&L) issued DoD Memorandum, “Delegation of Responsibilities under Departments of Defense Directive 2010.9, ‘Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements,’” July 19, 2017. The policy memorandum delegates to the Joint Staff the responsibility for allocation of ACSA ceilings to Defense agencies and issuance of program management guidance to Defense agencies and Military Departments. The OUSD(AT&L)’s actions taken partially addressed our recommendation; therefore, we consider this part of the recommendation closed.\n",
      "We recommend that the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition) designate a Chief of Naval Operations and Headquarters Marine Corps Office of Prime Responsibility to oversee the execution of the ACSA program for their respective Service Components.\n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, USSOCOM, issue interim guidance for the implementation and execution of the ACSA program.\n",
      "During the audit, on April 28, 2017, USSOCOM issued a policy memorandum to provide guidance for the use of ACSA authorities and the execution of ACSA orders. The policy memorandum provides roles and responsibilities and specific requirements for both logistics ACSA program managers and financial ACSA program managers. USSOCOM’s actions taken addressed our recommendation; therefore, this recommendation is closed.\n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, USAFRICOM, issue a formal ACSA instruction that includes requirements to complete the 25 minimum essential data elements and upload required supporting documentation in AGATRS.\n",
      "During the audit on June 20, 2017, USAFRICOM’s ACSA instruction, with requirements for minimum essential data elements and support documentation, was approved and signed. USAFRICOM’s actions taken addressed our recommendation; therefore, this recommendation is closed.\n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, U.S. Air Forces Africa, develop and implement a plan to properly track and maintain all orders for logistics support, supplies, and services, whether paid in cash or electronically, provided to foreign military personnel using ACSA authorities in AGATRS.\n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Africa, review U.S. Navy logistics support, supplies, and services provided to foreign military services in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility to determine whether the support and services are supplied under ACSA authority and for the support and services provided under ACSA, track and maintain ACSA orders in accordance with the updated DoD policy.\n",
      "We recommend that the CJCS issue program management guidance to Defense agencies and Military Departments as required by DoD Memorandum, “Delegation of Responsibilities under Departments of Defense Directive 2010.9, ‘Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements,’” July 19, 2017.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Director of International Cooperation, OUSD(AT&L), responding for the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, agreed with the recommendations to update the DoD Directive 2010.9 to define oversight responsibilities, require use of DoD system of record, and develop training program requirements. Therefore, these recommendations are resolved but will remain open. We will close these recommendations once we verify that the updated DoD Directive 2010.9 fully addresses the recommendations and that training program requirements were developed for the implementation and execution of the ACSA. We expect receipt of the training requirements no later than December 2018.\n",
      "The Director partially agreed with the recommendation to define ACSA order and billing officials’ roles and responsibilities and clarify what is acceptable for establishing parameters under ACSA authorities.\n",
      "The Director stated that the management detail for ACSA staff roles and responsibilities is addressed in CJCS Instruction 2120.01D and is now applicable to all DoD Components that use ACSA. The Director stated that the OUSD(AT&L) will consult with the Joint Staff to determine whether any changes in CJCS Instruction 2120.01D are necessary. The action taken that delegates to the Joint Staff the responsibility for issuing program management guidance satisfies the intent of this recommendation. Therefore, this recommendation is resolved but will remain open. We will close this recommendation once we verify that the OUSD(AT&L) and Joint Staff have determined whether changes in CJCS Instruction 2120.01D are necessary.\n",
      "The Director stated that the OUSD(AT&L) has determined that CJCS Instruction 2120.01D provides sufficient guidance concerning implementing arrangements. However, CJCS Instruction 2120.01D does not provide any guidance on a memorandum of understanding or any other arrangements that are acceptable for placing terms and conditions on the acquisition or transfer of logistics support, supplies, and services. Therefore, the recommendation to clarify what is acceptable for establishing parameters under ACSA authorities is unresolved and will remain open. We request that the Director provide guidance to DoD ACSA users for supplemental agreements to implementing arrangements under ACSA authority or update DoD Directive 2010.9 to clarify requirements on what is acceptable for establishing parameters under ACSA authorities.\n",
      "The Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition) did not respond to the finding and the recommendation to designate a Chief of Naval Operations and Headquarters Marine Corps Office of Prime Responsibility to oversee the execution of the ACSA program for their respective Service Components. Therefore, the recommendation is unresolved and will remain open. We request that the Assistant Secretary provide comments on the final report.\n",
      "The Chief, Logistics Readiness Division, U.S. Air Forces Africa, responding for the Commander, U.S. Air Forces Africa, disagreed with the finding and the recommendation to develop and implement a plan to properly track and maintain all orders for logistics support, supplies, and service, whether paid in cash or electronically, provided to foreign military personnel using AGATRS. The Chief stated that U.S. Air Forces Africa has a procedure in place to ensure the accurate tracking of logistics support, supplies, and services. Although a process was provided, it did not mention foreign national headcount totals and the associated cash collected on-site being placed on an ACSA order and the ACSA order being uploaded into AGATRS. Therefore, the recommendation is unresolved and will remain open. We request that the Chief provide documentation of the process, including the use of AGATRS and ACSA program manager role, the action or plan of dissemination to U.S. Air Forces Africa ACSA users, and the expected date of completion.\n",
      "The Chief of Staff, U.S. Naval Forces Africa, responding for the Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Africa, agreed with the finding and the recommendations to review U.S. Navy logistics support, supplies, and services provided to foreign military services to determine whether support and services are supplied under ACSA authority and to track and maintain the logistics support, supplies, and services provided under ACSA authority in accordance with DoD policy. Therefore, this recommendation is resolved but will remain open. We will close the recommendations once we verify the results of the review, and the training plan or documented training policy.\n",
      "The CJCS did not provide official comments; however, the Joint Staff took action to address the recommendation to issue program management guidance to Defense agencies and Military Departments.\n",
      "The Deputy Director for Strategic Logistics, Joint Staff J4, issued a memorandum reiterating that the OUSD(AT&L) delegated to the Joint Staff the responsibility to issue ACSA program management guidance. The Joint Staff J4 also notified the Military Departments that CJCS Instruction 2120.01D is applicable to the Military Departments and is the program management guidance the Departments should follow. The CJCS’s actions taken addressed our recommendation; therefore, this recommendation is closed.\n",

      "Objective\n",
      "We determined whether the Army properly managed the requirements of the Heavy Lift VII (HL7) commercial transportation contracts.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "The HL7 contracts provide commercial transportation for moving Army equipment, cargo, and personnel throughout the Middle East. The Heavy Lift program supports Operation Inherent Resolve. The Army uses four contractors to fulfill its heavy lift transportation requirements, with each contractor performing under a separate contract. The Heavy Lift program is in its seventh iteration, so these contracts are referred to as the HL7 contracts.\n",
      "The HL7 contracts were designed to provide transportation in Kuwait, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. In May 2016, Army Contracting Command–Rock Island (ACC-RI) awarded a $5.95 million task order on the HL7 contracts in support of Trans-Arabian Network (TAN) ground transportation. The TAN task order expanded the capabilities of the original HL7 contracts to transport cargo between Kuwait and Jordan, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates.\n",
      "This is the second audit on the HL7 contracts. The first audit (DODIG-2017-035) focused on the Army’s oversight of HL7 contractors in Kuwait and determined that the Army did not provide effective oversight or administration of the HL7 contracts.\n",
      "Finding\n",
      "The Army did not adequately manage the HL7 contract requirements. Specifically, the Army ordered an average of 39 percent more transportation assets than it needed throughout the life of the HL7 contracts.\n",
      "This occurred because the 1st Sustainment Command (Theater) (1st TSC) did not\n",
      "\n",
      "analyze HL7 asset usage for intra-Kuwait movements and did not continuously evaluate HL7 requirements so it could increase or decrease orders based on operational need; or\n",
      "identify and correct the inefficiencies in the Army’s planning and execution of theater transportation missions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Army requirement review boards did not require adequate information in order to properly validate the number of HL7 assets requested. Also, the Army over-ordered HL7 services because it did not properly plan the TAN task order and did not take appropriate measures to ensure its full operational use. Furthermore, ACC-RI included excessive guaranteed minimum payments to each of the HL7 contractors, which prompted the Army to order services to meet the guaranteed minimums rather than what was actually required within that period of performance.\n",
      "As a result, the Army wasted $53.6 million throughout the life of the HL7 contracts on services that it did not require.1 \n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), direct supported units to use the TAN, establish metrics for TAN movements, and perform quarterly assessments of the TAN’s performance and effectiveness.\n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, U.S. Army Central (ARCENT), develop procedures to ensure that requirement review boards not only validate the need for commercial transportation in the Middle East, but also validate the number of HL assets that 1st TSC requests.\n",
      "We recommend that the Executive Director, ACC-RI establish a reasonable and achievable guaranteed minimum on the Heavy Lift VIII (HL8) contracts to ensure the Army does not pay for services that it will not use.\n",
      "Additionally, we recommend that the Commander, 1st TSC, implement a systemic process for collecting HL asset usage and establish a consistent schedule for analyzing usage information in order to use quantitative and qualitative factors when forecasting requirement quantities on future task orders; review instances of poor mission planning and execution that resulted in ordering wasted assets and implement corrective actions to prevent those inefficiencies from re-occuring; and, update the requirement review process standard operating procedures to ensure requirements packages that are submitted to the review boards include all information necessary for the board to make an informed decision.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "The Chief, CENTCOM Logistics and Engineering Directorate, Distribution Division, on behalf of the Commander, CENTCOM, agreed with our findings and recommendation to direct supported units to use the TAN, establish metrics for TAN movements, and perform quarterly assessments of the TAN’s performance and effectiveness. CENTCOM issued an Execute Order during the audit that directed subordinate units to use the TAN. Furthermore, the Execute Order directed ARCENT, in coordination with the CENTCOM Deployment and Distribution Operations Center, to develop appropriate metrics to support, at a minimum, quarterly assessments of the TAN’s performance and effectiveness. This recommendation is resolved and will be closed when the actions are fully implemented.\n",
      "The G-4 (Chief), ARCENT Logistics, on behalf of the Commander, ARCENT, agreed with our findings and recommendation to develop procedures that ensure requirement review boards not only validate the need for commercial transportation in the Middle East, but also validate the number of HL assets that 1st TSC requests. However, the Chief, ARCENT Logistics, did not elaborate on how or when updated procedures would be developed. Therefore, the recommendation is unresolved and will remain open. We request that the Commander, ARCENT provide comments on the final report for this recommendation. We will consider the recommendation resolved once we receive the specific actions that will be taken to develop updated procedures that ensure requirement review boards are validating entire requirements.\n",
      "The Chief, ARCENT Logistics, on behalf of the Commander, 1st TSC, agreed with our recommendations. During the audit, the 1st TSC began collecting and analyzing daily HL7 usage information. For a long-term solution, the 1st TSC is implementing an auditable transportation system of record to accurately forecast HL requirements. Furthermore, in an effort to implement corrective actions to improve HL7 utilization, 1st TSC initiated a weekly working group to monitor utilization and track factors that led to inefficiencies in the program. Members of the working group are also developing standard operating procedures to document the controls needed to more effectively manage HL mission execution. In addition, during the audit, 1st TSC personnel began providing usage information to the review boards for validation and are updating the requirement review process standard operating procedure to ensure the approval authority receives all required information to make an informed decision on the requested requirement. The recommendations are resolved and will be closed when we verify that the commands have implemented the proposed actions.\n",
      "The Executive Director, ACC-RI, did not respond to the recommendation to establish a reasonable and achievable guaranteed minimum on the HL8 contracts to ensure the Army does not pay for services that it will not use. However, during the audit, we discussed our observations with the ACC-RI contracting officer regarding the guaranteed minimum, and the ACC-RI contracting officer subsequently solicited for the HL8 contract with a more conservative guaranteed minimum of $1 million per contractor. The management actions taken will address our concerns regarding guaranteed minimums and should ensure that the Army uses the services it orders with the HL8 guaranteed payments. Therefore, the recommendation is resolved and will be closed when the HL8 contract is awarded. We are not requesting additional comments from ACC-RI.\n",

      "Background\n",
      "The DoD conducts CN activities, such as evidence collection training and border outpost construction, to help partner nations disrupt the transport and transfer of illegal drugs. \n",
      "The ODASD CN&GT is responsible for ensuring that the DoD develops and implements a focused CN program with clear priorities and measured results. The ODASD CN&GT transfers CN funds in the DoD Central Transfer Account to the Military Services for execution of the COCOM’s CN program. The USCENTCOM J3 Interagency Action Group-CN and the USAFRICOM J51 CN and Transnational Threats Programs division are responsible for overseeing CN activities in their geographic areas of responsibility. \n",
      "The DoD CN and Global Threats Strategy requires COCOMs to integrate the DoD strategic goals and objectives with the COCOM’s respective strategic plans, such as the Theater Campaign Plan (TCP). A TCP provides objectives that are the foundation for the COCOM’s CN strategy. Each COCOM is then responsible for planning and executing CN activities within its area of responsibility based on the specific drug-related threats and the objectives in the TCP.\n",
      " \n",
      "Findings\n",
      "USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM did not provide effective oversight of CN activities in FYs 2014 through 2016. Specifically, neither USCENTCOM nor USAFRICOM maintained reliable data for the completion status and funding of training, equipping, and construction activities. In addition, USCENTCOM could have more effectively planned its CN activities by identifying the command’s TCP objective to be achieved with each CN activity conducted. \n",
      "This occurred because USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM did not establish procedures for tracking the completion status and funding of each CN activity. Instead, both USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM relied on the Military Service components and partner agencies to track CN activity funding. Additionally, USCENTCOM did not have a formal process for linking individual CN activities to a TCP objective. \n",
      "As a result, USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM cannot determine whether their CN programs effectively used the $496 million reported as transferred from ODASD CN&GT in FYs 2014 through 2016 to counter illicit drug trafficking. Specifically, the USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM CN programs lacked continuity in their program management resulting in incoming CN officials implementing inconsistent processes. In addition, without consistently tracking funding, USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM could be using inaccurate data when reporting funding to the ODASD CN&GT, and may not know how much funding they have available for unfunded CN activities. For example, USAFRICOM CN officials missed an opportunity to use unspent funds because they were not aware that a law enforcement agency did not spend about $805,000 of USAFRICOM CN funds obligated in FYs 2014 and 2015. \n",
      "The ODASD CN&GT’s and COCOMs’ lack of effective program management that was identified in DODIG-2017-119 and again in this report raises the larger concern of the DoD’s inability to manage its CN program and maximize opportunities to assist its partner nations in t heir CN efforts. Without effective program management at the DoD’s strategic and operational levels, the DoD lacks the ability to make informed decisions and hold agency officials accountable for mismanaged funds.\n",
      " \n",
      "Management Actions Taken \n",
      "In April and July 2017, we advised USCENTCOM J3 Interagency Action Group-CN and USAFRICOM J51 CN and Transnational Threats Programs division officials of the deficiencies related to the oversight of CN activities. Specifically, we addressed the lack of reliable data related to the completion status and funding of CN activities in FYs 2014 through 2016, as well as the lack of established procedures for maintaining oversight of CN activities. In addition, we advised USCENTCOM J3 Interagency Action Group-CN officials regarding the lack of procedures linking CN activities to the USCENTCOM TCP objectives. \n",
      "The USCENTCOM J3 Interagency Action Group‑CN Division Chief agreed with our findings and initiated corrective actions. Specifically, USCENTCOM CN officials agreed to update and consolidate their draft business rules to address the lack of documented procedures to track the funding of CN activities. The updated business rules also require a self-audit of at least two activities each fiscal year to verify that information received from the Military Services is correct. \n",
      "The USAFRICOM J51 Division Chief agreed with our findings and initiated corrective actions. Specifically, the USAFRICOM J51 developed and formalized standard operating procedures for maintaining oversight of CN activities. A USAFRICOM CN official stated that in the long‑term, a newly-implemented web‑based tracking system, the Integrated USAFRICOM Theater Synchronization System, would be used to track completion status and funding data for all CN activities. The USAFRICOM J51 standard operating procedures also require an annual self‑audit to verify that USAFRICOM CN officials are adequately tracking CN activities.\n",
      " \n",
      " Recommendations\n",
      "We recommend that, as part of the processes and procedures recommended in DODIG-2017-119, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats define the COCOMs’ and Military Services’ roles and responsibilities for oversight of CN activities, to include tracking the completion status and funding of individual CN activities. \n",
      "We recommend the Directors, USCENTCOM J3 and USAFRICOM J5 develop and formalize procedures to track the completion status and funding of CN activities. We further recommend that the Director, USCENTCOM J3, develop and formalize procedures to link each CN activity to the TCP objectives.\n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) accurately reported general property, plant, and equipment on its financial statements. We reviewed USSOCOM General Equipment because it represented 85 percent of USSOCOM FY 2015 general property, plant, and equipment.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "USSOCOM overstated its General Equipment account balance by $5.7 billion and could not support another $261 million in General Equipment on its FY 2015 financial statements. USSOCOM also understated its General Equipment account balance by $1.4 billion on its first quarter FY 2016 financial statements. In addition, USSOCOM did not obtain all the critical data elements needed from its Component Special Operations Command (SOC) property systems needed to accurately report its General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation account balances. Furthermore, the Component SOC property systems did not contain accurate and complete data needed for USSOCOM to correctly report its General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation account balances. Finally, $145 million in Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) General Equipment was reported on both USSOCOM and Marine Corps financial statements. \n",
      "This occurred because USSOCOM did not develop adequate standard operating procedures (SOPs) to report its General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation account balances. In addition, USSOCOM did not successfully coordinate with Component SOC personnel to obtain the information needed to accurately report its General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation on its financial statements. Furthermore, Component SOC property systems were unable to accurately value General Equipment. Lastly, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Deputy Chief Financial Officer (OUSD[C]/DCFO) memorandum guidance was not clear regarding which entity should report the General Equipment on its financial statements. \n",
      "Unless actions are taken, USSOCOM’s General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation account balances will continue to be misstated and unsupported, and its financial statements will continue to be misstated. USSOCOM’s inability to produce accurate General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation account balances may also impact the accuracy of the DoD Agency-Wide financial statements because the USSOCOM General Equipment account balance is significant to the DoD Agency-Wide financial statements. Furthermore, Component SOC General Equipment will continue to be reported on two sets of financial statements, resulting in duplicate reporting.\n",
      " \n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The Chief Financial Officer (CFO)/Comptroller, USSOCOM, stated that USSOCOM management self-identified and communicated to us many of the weaknesses and misstatements that we identified in the report, and that it was in the process of identifying the causes and taking corrective action. In addition, USSOCOM stated that it communicated to the audit team that numerous property system processes had changed during the audit time period. The CFO/Comptroller also stated that the financial reporting of General Equipment continues to evolve across the DoD and that the OUSD(C)/CFO is developing an updated policy on the financial reporting responsibilities for PP&E. \n",
      "At the start of the audit, we recognized that USSOCOM General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation account balances may be misstated and that USSOCOM was identifying the causes and developing corrective action plans to prepare for its FY 2018 financial statement audit. This report shows the pervasive problems that USSOCOM has with accurately reporting its General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation account balances and makes formal recommendations to improve the reporting of General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation within USSOCOM and throughout the DoD. We acknowledge in the report that many of the processes and Component SOC property systems that USSOCOM uses to calculate the General Equipment and Accumulated account balances are changing. We also acknowledge that the financial reporting of General Equipment within the DoD is evolving and will continue to change as new reporting requirements are established. However, we conducted this audit using the financial reporting requirements for General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation that existed at the time of the audit.\n",
      "Recommendations, Management Comments, and Our Response:\n",
      "The Financial Improvement and Audit Remediation Director (FIAR Director), responding for the OUSD(C)/DCFO, agreed with the recommendations to update its accounting policy relating to the transferring and reporting of General Equipment balances between entities and clearly distinguish which entity should maintain the accounting of the General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation balances and report the balances on the Component’s financial statements. Managements comments were responsive and met the intent of the recommendations; therefore, they are resolved but will remain open. We will close these recommendations once we verify that the FIAR Director has updated the policy and incorporated it into the DoD FMR. \n",
      "The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Operations), responding for the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Financial Management and Comptroller), neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations to provide accurate and complete data elements to USSOCOM and develop milestones for providing these data elements. However, the Deputy Assistant Secretary stated its working with USSOCOM to identify all the USSOCOM assets that are managed in Army property systems and that its efforts have resulted in the identification of the data elements needed for USSOCOM to report General Equipment on its financial statements. The Army expects to complete these actions by the fourth quarter of FY 2018. The proposed and ongoing actions addressed the intent of our recommendations; therefore, the recommendations are resolved but will remain open. We will close these recommendations once we verify that the Army has identified all of USSOCOM assets in Army property systems and has provided accurate and complete data elements to USSOCOM. \n",
      "The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Operations), responding for the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller), disagreed with the recommendations to provide accurate and complete data elements to USSOCOM and develop milestones for providing these data elements. Comments from the Deputy Assistant Secretary did not address the specifics of the recommendation; therefore, we request that the Deputy Assistant Secretary reconsider her position on these recommendations and provide additional comments to the final report. \n",
      "The Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Operations), responding for the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management and Comptroller), agreed with the recommendations to provide accurate and complete data elements to USSOCOM and develop milestones for providing this information. The Air Force comments were responsive to the intent of the recommendations; therefore, they are resolved but will remain open. We will close these recommendations once we verify that the Air Force has identified all of USSOCOM assets in Air Force property systems and has provided accurate and complete data elements to USSOCOM.\n",
      "The Audit Coordination Head, responding for the Marine Corps Comptroller, agreed with the intent of the recommendations to provide accurate and complete data elements to USSOCOM and develop milestones for providing this information to the extent property systems can accommodate implementation. The Marine Corps comments only partially addressed the recommendation to provide accurate and complete data elements to USSOCOM. We request the CFO/Comptroller provide additional comments to these recommendations in response to the final report. \n",
      "The USSOCOM CFO/Comptroller, responding for the Director of Accounting, agreed or partially agreed with the recommendation or the intent of the recommendations to revise USSOCOM SOPs on the reporting of General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation. The CFO/Comptroller stated that USSOCOM has updated and will continue to update its SOPs to include the following: identify the critical data elements needed from the Component SOC property systems (Recommendation 6.a.1); identify the source of USSOCOM General Equipment (6.a.2); identify the documentation needed to support USSOCOM General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation journal voucher (6.a.3); identify the staff positions for determining whether the journal voucher is accurate and supported (6.a.4); provide the policies and procedures for calculating Depreciation and Accumulated Depreciation account balances when this information is not provided by the Component SOC property systems (6.a.5); and include procedures for reconciling the USSOCOM General Equipment and Accumulated Depreciation account balances regarding additions and subtraction from these account balances from one reporting period to the next reporting period (6.a.6). The CFO/Comptroller comments to Recommendations 6.a.1 and 6.a.6 addressed all the specifics of the recommendations and no further action is needed. The CFO/Comptroller comments to Recommendations 6.a.3 and 6.a.4 addressed all the specifics of the recommendations and are considered resolved, but additional information is needed to close these recommendations. The CFO/Comptroller comments for Recommendations 6.a.2 and 6.a.5 only partially addressed the recommendations. We request the CFO/Comptroller provide additional comments to these recommendations in response to the final report. \n",
      "The CFO/Comptroller agreed or partially agreed with the recommendations to assist Component SOC personnel in identifying all the critical data elements USSOCOM needs (6.b); obtain read only access to Component SOC property systems (6.c); to review and verify that the General Equipment being reported on the USSOCOM Balance Sheet reconciles to the Component SOC property systems (6.d), and request the USD(C)/CFO to make a determination on whether USSOCOM or the Marine Corps should report certain General Equipment (6.e). The CFO/Comptroller comments to Recommendations 6.b addressed all the specifics of the recommendation and is considered resolved, but additional information is needed to close the recommendation. The CFO/Comptroller comments for Recommendations 6.c, 6.d, and 6.e only partially addressed the recommendations. We request the CFO/Comptroller provide additional comments to these recommendations in response to the final report. \n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "We determined whether U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) was identifying excess equipment and storing only equipment with valid requirements in its inventory. We nonstatistically selected five Special Operations–Peculiar (SO-P) equipment programs to include in the audit—Binocular Night Vision Device, Future Assault Shell Technology- Helmet, Next Generation Tactical Communication Capability (Handheld Radio), Sensitive Site Exploitation‑Biometrics, and Suite of Integrated Radio Frequency Countermeasures.\n",
      "Background:\n",
      "USSOCOM provides SO-P equipment to USSOCOM units. USSOCOM establishes the requirements for SO-P equipment through an internal review and approval process, culminating with the final approval of SO-P equipment requirements by the Vice Commander, USSOCOM. During the review and approval process, USSOCOM establishes the total amount of the SO-P equipment needed to perform USSOCOM missions (authorized allowance). USSOCOM also determines the amount of the authorized allowance to be allocated to each Service Component commands, theater special operations commands, and other users. \n",
      "SO-P equipment authorizations are recorded in the USSOCOM Table of Equipment Distribution and Allowances (USTEDA). The USTEDA is designed to maintain the authorization and allocation quantities for SO-P equipment, identify the total USSOCOM authorization, and indicate the amount of equipment allocated to the Service Component commands, the theater special operations commands, and the program manager. \n",
      "DoD Manual 4140.01, Volume 6, defines excess equipment as equipment that is more than the amount needed to meet mission requirements and is subject to return, redistribution, or disposal. USSOCOM Directive 700-22 defines excess equipment as SO-P equipment that exceeds the command’s authorized allowance. Therefore, to identify excess SO-P equipment, USSOCOM officials must know the authorized allowance for each SO-P equipment program and the amount allocated to each Service Component command. USSOCOM officials must then compare those amounts to the SO-P equipment inventory. If inventory is more than the overall authorized allowance or the Service Component command has more than its allocation, the equipment is excess. Excess equipment could result from USSOCOM erroneously buying more equipment than authorized, from distributing equipment incorrectly, or from a failure to dispose of equipment replaced by newer models.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "USSOCOM did not identify that the Service Component commands’ inventory exceeded their allocation for three of the five SO-P programs included in our nonstatistical sample. Across the three programs with excess equipment, we identified excess SO-P equipment with a value of at least $26.3 million. For example, USSOCOM did not identify that the U.S. Army Special Operations Command had 17,571 handheld radios according to its property records but was allocated only 13,351 in the capability documents, for an excess of 4,220 radios. \n",
      "USSOCOM did not identify excess SO-P equipment because the authorized allowance and allocation data in the USTEDA were not accurate or complete, and could not be reconciled with inventory. In addition, USSOCOM guidance did not require periodic reconciliations between the inventory and the USTEDA to identify excess SO-P equipment for redistribution or disposition.\n",
      "As a result, USSOCOM is not effectively managing excess SO-P equipment in the programs reviewed. Because USSOCOM officials were not identifying excess equipment at the Service Component commands, USSOCOM was not aware that there was excess equipment available for redistribution to the Service Component commands or disposal if all the commands had reached their full allocation of authorized allowances. For example, USSOCOM allocated kits to the Naval Special Warfare Command. According to the Naval Special Warfare Command accountable property system of record, the command had excess kits. Had USSOCOM identified those kits as excess, the kits could have been redistributed to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, which had not received its full allocation.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the Commander, USSOCOM:\n",
      "\n",
      "Update USSOCOM guidance to include detailed procedures for reporting and updating SO-P equipment authorizations and allocations in the USTEDA. The procedures should provide clear and concise policy outlining the source of the authorization data and how this data should be presented, and should establish periodic reviews of the information to ensure that the authorizations match the capability documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct a review of existing SO-P equipment authorizations and allocations and update the USTEDA and all systems and documents that contain authorizations and allocations accordingly.\n",

      "Management Comments and Our Response:\n",
      "The USSOCOM Director, Special Operations Forces, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, agreed with the report finding and all of the recommendations. The Director agreed to update USSOCOM guidance to include detailed procedures for reporting and updating SO-P equipment authorizations and allocations in the USTEDA. He stated that once USSOCOM updates guidance to establish procedures for capturing and reporting authorizations, the USSOCOM Directorate of Logistics will compare the authorizations in the requirements documents to the USTEDA and modify the USTEDA as needed. \n",

      "Objective:\n",
      "This report has been updated to ensure compliance with the U.S. Workforce Rehabilitation Act of 1973, section 508.  Formatting revisions may have resulted in minor changes to the appearance of the report; however, no changes were made regarding facts or content.\n",
      "We performed this audit in response to a FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requirement for the DoD Office of Inspector General to provide a report on the schedule delays and cost increases related to the construction of the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) replacement facility at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. We reviewed the requirements development, design-bid-build contract award processes, design suitability, and contractor performance.\n",
      "Findings:\n",
      "To fulfill the NDAA requirement, we report on the following five elements. \n",
      "First, we examine the specific reasons the DoD has used to explain the 16-month schedule delay and 10-percent cost increase. We determined that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Omaha District personnel experienced multiple delays and cost increases to the USSTRATCOM replacement facility because of the lack of expert involvement in the requirements development, inaccurate cost estimates, design deficiencies, contract modifications, fire, floods, mold, and challenges related to the execution of contract modifications. As of February 2018, project costs have increased 9.4 percent from the programmed amount of $564 million to $617.1 million, and construction completion has been delayed 29 months. \n",
      "Second, we examine the specific actions taken to prevent further schedule delays and cost increases on this project as well as lessons learned to apply to future projects. We determined that the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment (OASD[EI&E]), the Air Force Civil Engineer Center, USACE Headquarters, and USACE Omaha District have implemented or are implementing several initiatives.\n",
      "These initiatives include updated guidance on roles, responsibilities, and management controls; additional training programs for cost estimators; and after-action reviews for all building projects.\n",
      "Third, we identify ongoing or completed proceedings or investigations of parties responsible for the delays or cost increases. According to USACE Omaha District personnel, two separate contract claims are in litigation in the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.\n",
      "Fourth, we describe administrative actions taken as a result of the proceedings or investigations identified in Element 3. As of March 2018, two contract claims are in litigation and have not yet been resolved; therefore, there are no results or associated administrative actions to report at this time.\n",
      "Fifth, we provide a summary of changes we believe may be required for future military construction projects to prevent the problems we identified in the USSTRATCOM replacement facility project and to apply the lessons learned. We determined that improvements are necessary for future military construction projects. The recommendations below are addressed to key DoD organizations involved in the USSTRATCOM replacement facility project but should be applied as guidelines for all DoD construction projects.\n",
      "Recommendations:\n",
      "We recommend that the OASD (EI&E):\n",
      "\n",
      "develop guidance requiring DoD organizations involved with a military construction project to draft a charter at the beginning of the project life cycle, focusing on communications and accountability in their project management plan; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "develop guidance establishing metrics that include financial risk management parameters and triggers when higher headquarters engagement is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recommend that the USSTRATCOM and USACE Commanders complete after-action reviews following completion of the construction for the USSTRATCOM replacement facility and implement the lessons learned in any ongoing or new construction projects under their oversight. \n",
      "In addition, we recommend that the USSTRATCOM Commander review the administrative actions of individuals involved in the cost increases or schedule delays of the USSTRATCOM replacement facility and initiate action as appropriate.\n",
      "We also recommend that the USACE Commander issue guidance to implement lessons learned from the USSTRATCOM facility construction project in other military construction projects that contain DoD-unique requirements and issue a memorandum instructing contracting personnel involved with the USSTRATCOM facility construction project to issue yearly past performance evaluations as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. In addition, we recommend that the USACE Commander review the administrative actions of individuals involved in the cost increases or schedule delays of the USSTRATCOM replacement facility and initiate action as appropriate.\n",
      "We recommend that the U.S. Air Force Civil Engineer Center Commander conduct program life-cycle evaluations to determine the success of the Cost Estimating Improvement Plan.\n",
      "Management Comments and Our Response\n",
      "OASD (EI&E), USSTRATCOM, USACE, and U.S. Air Force agreed with our findings and recommendations. \n",
      "The USACE Commander also reviewed the actions of the individuals involved in the cost increases or schedule delays of the USSTRATCOM replacement facility and concluded that no individuals should be held directly accountable.\n",
      "We will close the remaining recommendations upon completion and verification of the proposed corrective actions.\n",

Specifically, the DATA Act improves the quality of data submitted to USASpending.gov. by holding Federal agencies accountable for the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted. The DATA Act required the OMB and the Treasury to establish Government-wide financial data elements over Federal funds by May 2015. Therefore, in May 2015, the OMB and the Treasury issued standardized data elements with definitions and required Federal agencies to report financial and award data in accordance with these elements for publication on USASpending.gov by May 2017. The OMB also issued OMB Memorandum No. 2016-03 requiring agencies to designate a Senior Accountable Official (SAO), who, on a quarterly basis, must provide reasonable assurance that the agency’s internal controls support reliability and validity of the financial and award data submitted to the Treasury for publication on USASpending.gov. \n",
      "The DATA Act also required agency Inspectors General and the Government Accountability Office to review a statistically valid sample of the data their agencies submitted under the DATA Act and report to Congress on the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of the data sampled and the implementation and use of the data elements. \n",
